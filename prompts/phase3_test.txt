PHASE 3 OF 3: TESTING & POLISH
===============================

You are validating and polishing an educational game renderer. This phase focuses on TESTING and FINAL POLISH.

PREREQUISITE: The renderer should have Phase 1 and Phase 2 marked complete in its ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment.

OBJECTIVE: Ensure the game works flawlessly, teaches effectively, and meets premium quality standards.

TESTING PROTOCOL
----------------

1. FUNCTIONALITY TESTING
Run through the entire game and verify:
[ ] Every button/slider/toggle responds correctly
[ ] Every screen transition works smoothly
[ ] No blank screens or broken states
[ ] All animations complete properly
[ ] All feedback appears correctly
[ ] No TypeScript errors (run: bash scripts/run_checks.sh)

2. LEARNING VALIDATION
For each concept taught, verify:
[ ] The WHY is explicitly shown (not just stated)
[ ] Predictions are compared to actual results
[ ] Misconceptions are confronted
[ ] User must articulate understanding

3. USABILITY TESTING (10-Year-Old Test)
[ ] Is the ONE action obvious within 5 seconds?
[ ] Are all interactive elements clearly interactive?
[ ] Is feedback immediate and understandable?
[ ] Can someone complete each screen without reading?

4. EXPERT TEST
[ ] Are scenarios authentic to real practice?
[ ] Are numbers/values realistic?
[ ] Would a professional recognize this as accurate?

FIX ANY ISSUES FOUND
--------------------
Common issues to fix:
- Missing state initialization
- Buttons that don't work
- Screens with no clear action
- Missing feedback after actions
- Confusing instructions
- Broken progression (can't advance)
- Visual inconsistencies

POLISH CHECKLIST
----------------
[ ] Consistent color palette throughout
[ ] All text is readable (contrast, size)
[ ] Animations are smooth (not janky)
[ ] Loading states where needed
[ ] Error states handled gracefully
[ ] Mobile-friendly (if applicable)

FINAL OUTPUT
------------
1. Fix any bugs or issues found
2. Update the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment to mark Phase 3 complete:

/*
 * ENHANCEMENT PLAN - [GAME NAME]
 * Phase 1 Complete: Research & Design
 * Phase 2 Complete: Implementation
 * Phase 3 Complete: Testing & Polish
 *
 * FINAL STATUS:
 * - Screens: [count] fully functional screens
 * - Concepts taught: [X]/10 with WHY mechanics
 * - Quality gates passed: Functionality, Learning, Design, Experience
 *
 * GAME COMPLETE
 */

3. Run final check: bash scripts/run_checks.sh
4. Ensure game is fully playable from start to finish

QUALITY GATES (All must pass)
-----------------------------
GATE 1 - FUNCTIONALITY:
[ ] Zero crashes or broken states
[ ] All interactions work correctly
[ ] Complete game playable without refresh

GATE 2 - LEARNING:
[ ] Each concept has clear WHY revelation
[ ] Misconceptions are confronted
[ ] User can articulate principles

GATE 3 - DESIGN:
[ ] Meets premium visual standard
[ ] Consistent visual language
[ ] Animations smooth and purposeful

GATE 4 - EXPERIENCE:
[ ] Self-paced with no frustration
[ ] Satisfying to complete

IMPORTANT:
- This is the final quality check - be thorough
- Fix issues, don't just note them
- The game must be production-ready when complete
- If major issues exist, fix them before marking complete
