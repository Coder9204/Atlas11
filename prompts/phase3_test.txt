PHASE 3 OF 8: TESTING & POLISH
===============================

SKILL FILES TO LOAD:
- .claude/skills/verification.md (PRIMARY - follow the complete verification checklist)
- .claude/skills/uiux-designer.md (7 Laws compliance check)

You are validating and polishing an educational game renderer. This phase focuses on TESTING and FINAL POLISH.

PREREQUISITE: All Phase 2 sub-phases must be complete in the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment.

OBJECTIVE: Apply Skill 6 (Verification) to ensure the game works flawlessly AND teaches effectively.

TEST 1: FUNCTIONALITY (from Skill 6)
------------------------------------
Run through the ENTIRE game. Every path. Every button.

□ All screens load without errors
□ Navigation works in all directions
□ Progress persists through session
□ Zero console errors
□ No blank screens or frozen states
□ All buttons respond to clicks
□ All sliders update values instantly (<100ms)
□ Game NEVER requires refresh to continue

TEST 2: LEARNING EFFECTIVENESS (from Skill 6)
---------------------------------------------
Apply the 5-Question Test. After completing, a user should be able to answer:

1. WHAT: Can they describe the core relationship?
   "When X increases, Y increases because Z"

2. WHY: Can they explain the mechanism?
   "This happens because..."

3. PREDICT: Can they estimate outcomes for new numbers?
   "If I set X to 50, Y will be approximately..."

4. AVOID: Do they know the common misconception?
   "Most people think X, but actually Y"

5. APPLY: Can they use it for a real decision?
   "If I were in situation X, I would do Y because..."

The Teaching Test:
> Can someone who completed this explain the concept to a friend—without ever reading a definition?

If yes → Success
If no → The learning is still in text, not mechanics. FIX THIS.

TEST 3: ADAPTIVE QUALITY (from Skill 6)
---------------------------------------
□ Predictions compare to actual results
□ Misconceptions are confronted directly
□ WHY explanations are clear (causal chain)
□ Feedback messages are warm and encouraging

TEST 4: FLOW STATE (from Skill 6)
---------------------------------
□ First-attempt success rate feels achievable (30-70%)
□ Players want to continue (not giving up)
□ Failure feels like learning, not punishment
□ Success feels earned, not given

TEST 5: DESIGN QUALITY (from Skill 2)
-------------------------------------
Check all 7 Laws:

□ Law 1: Each screen has ONE clear purpose
□ Law 2: 10-year-old understands in 3 seconds
□ Law 3: Only essential info shown (progressive disclosure)
□ Law 4: Every action has immediate feedback
□ Law 5: Undo/Reset always available
□ Law 6: Animations explain, not decorate
□ Law 7: Works for accessibility (44px touch targets, focus states)

Visual Design Check:
□ Colors follow semantic system (blue=action, green=success, amber=warning)
□ Typography is clean with clear hierarchy
□ Spacing uses 8-point grid
□ Consistent visual language throughout

TEST 6: CHILD-APPROPRIATENESS (from Skill 6)
--------------------------------------------
□ Scenarios feature relatable characters/situations
□ Stakes are things children care about
□ Numbers are comprehensible for age group
□ Language is clear, no jargon
□ Failure messages are encouraging, not punishing
□ No time pressure that causes anxiety

FIX ANY ISSUES FOUND
--------------------
Common issues to fix:
- Missing state initialization
- Buttons that don't respond
- Screens with no clear action
- Missing feedback after actions
- Touch targets under 44px
- Missing focus states
- WHY explanations that are too abstract
- Misconceptions not being confronted

FINAL SHIP CHECKLIST (from Skill 6)
-----------------------------------
All gates must pass:

GATE 1 - FUNCTIONALITY:
□ Zero crashes or broken states
□ All interactions work correctly
□ Complete game playable without refresh

GATE 2 - LEARNING:
□ Each concept has clear WHY revelation
□ Misconceptions are confronted
□ User can articulate principles (not just recall)
□ Transfer possible to new contexts

GATE 3 - DESIGN:
□ 7 Laws all passing
□ Premium visual standard (Apple/Airbnb/Nike quality)
□ Animations smooth and purposeful

GATE 4 - CHILD-FRIENDLY:
□ 3-second clarity test passes
□ Relatable scenarios and stakes
□ Encouraging failure states
□ Big touch targets (≥44px)

FINAL OUTPUT
------------
1. Fix ALL bugs or issues found
2. Update the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment:

/*
 * ENHANCEMENT PLAN - [GAME NAME]
 * Phase 1 Complete: Research & Design
 * Phase 2 Complete: Implementation (10 concepts + scenarios)
 * Phase 3 Complete: Testing & Polish
 *
 * VERIFICATION RESULTS:
 * - Functionality: PASS (zero errors)
 * - Learning: PASS (5-question test verified)
 * - Design: PASS (7 Laws compliant)
 * - Child-Friendly: PASS
 *
 * FINAL STATUS:
 * - Screens: [count] fully functional screens
 * - Concepts taught: 10/10 with WHY mechanics
 * - Quality gates: ALL PASSED
 *
 * GAME COMPLETE - SHIP READY
 */

3. Run final check: bash scripts/run_checks.sh
4. Ensure game is fully playable from start to finish

THE ULTIMATE TEST (from Skill 6)
--------------------------------
After playing, users can:
□ NAME the concept
□ EXPLAIN how it works (the mechanism)
□ PREDICT new outcomes
□ APPLY to real decisions
□ TEACH it to someone else

WITHOUT ever being "taught" explicitly.

ALL GATES PASSED? → Output: DONE [GAME] PHASE 3
ANY GATE FAILED? → Fix and re-test before marking complete
