PHASE 2 OF 3: IMPLEMENTATION
=============================

You are implementing enhancements to an educational game renderer. This phase focuses on BUILDING the improvements designed in Phase 1.

PREREQUISITE: The renderer should have an ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block from Phase 1. Read it first.

OBJECTIVE: Implement the WHY-teaching mechanics, game flow, and visual design based on the Phase 1 plan.

IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES
-------------------------

1. WHY-TEACHING MECHANICS (Most Critical)
Every interaction must follow the Prediction-Action-Revelation loop:
- PREDICT: User commits to what they think will happen
- ACT: User manipulates a variable (slider, button, drag)
- OBSERVE: Immediate visual feedback shows result
- COMPARE: Show prediction vs actual
- REVEAL WHY: Explain the causal mechanism
- ARTICULATE: User confirms understanding

2. GAME FLOW
- 10+ screens covering the core concepts
- Each screen has ONE action and ONE learning goal
- Clear progression from simple to complex
- Integration points where multiple concepts combine

3. VISUAL STANDARDS (Apple/Airbnb/Nike quality)
- Generous white space
- Clean typography hierarchy
- Subtle, realistic shadows
- One clear focal point per screen
- Smooth animations (200-400ms)
- Interactive elements obviously tappable

4. SCREEN STRUCTURE
For each screen implement:
- Clear instruction (max 8 words, starts with verb)
- Single interactive element
- Immediate feedback (<100ms)
- WHY explanation after action
- Clear transition to next screen

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
------------------------
[ ] Read the Phase 1 ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment
[ ] Implement screens for at least 5 of the 10 concepts
[ ] Each concept has: intro -> interaction -> feedback -> WHY reveal
[ ] Include prediction mechanics (user guesses before seeing result)
[ ] Add misconception confrontation (show why intuition was wrong)
[ ] Implement at least 2 real-world scenarios
[ ] Add progress tracking (screen X of Y)
[ ] Include score/feedback system
[ ] Polish visuals (gradients, shadows, animations)

CODE QUALITY
------------
- Use React hooks properly (useState, useEffect)
- Keep state management simple and local
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Ensure TypeScript types are correct
- No console errors or warnings

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
1. Update the renderer with full implementation
2. Update the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment to mark Phase 2 complete:

/*
 * ENHANCEMENT PLAN - [GAME NAME]
 * Phase 1 Complete: Research & Design
 * Phase 2 Complete: Implementation
 *
 * IMPLEMENTED:
 * - [X] Screens: [count] screens covering [X] concepts
 * - [X] WHY mechanics: prediction-reveal loops
 * - [X] Scenarios: [list implemented scenarios]
 * - [X] Visual polish: gradients, animations, feedback
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 3: Testing
 */

3. The game must be PLAYABLE from start to finish
4. Run: bash scripts/run_checks.sh to verify no TypeScript errors

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on quality over quantity - 5 well-designed screens beat 20 rushed ones
- Every screen must teach WHY, not just WHAT
- If the existing game is good, enhance it; don't rewrite from scratch
- Preserve any good existing functionality
