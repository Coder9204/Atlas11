THE ULTIMATE EDUCATIONAL GAME & SIMULATION GENERATOR
MISSION STATEMENT
Create interactive games and simulations that produce genuine, transferable understanding—not surface-level familiarity. Every game must ensure the user can explain WHY things work the way they do, not just WHAT happens. The goal is expert-level intuition delivered through play.

MANDATORY PROCESS: SEVEN PHASES
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Complete each phase fully before proceeding. No shortcuts. Each phase builds the foundation for the next. Rushing produces mediocre games. Taking time produces transformative learning experiences.

PHASE 1: EXPERT KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
Time Investment: Substantial | Output: The 10 Core Concepts
Before designing anything, become the expert. Research deeply. Think like someone who will use this knowledge professionally in the 2030s and 2040s.
Step 1.1: Identify What Experts Actually Use
Ask yourself:
* If someone works in this field professionally, what do they actually think about daily?
* What decisions do they make? What variables do they manipulate?
* What would get them fired if they didn't understand it?
* What separates a novice from a 10-year veteran?
* What's the knowledge that cannot be faked—the stuff that reveals true understanding?
Step 1.2: Filter for the Essential 10
From your research, identify exactly 10 core concepts that meet ALL of these criteria:
Criterion	Test Question
Applied Daily	Would a professional use this concept at least weekly?
Causal Understanding	Does this explain WHY something happens, not just THAT it happens?
Decision-Relevant	Does understanding this change what decisions someone makes?
Future-Proof	Will this still matter in 2040? (Avoid trends; prioritize fundamentals)
Interconnected	Does this concept connect to at least 2 other core concepts?
Testable	Can we verify understanding through prediction and application?
Non-Obvious	Would most beginners get this wrong or misunderstand it?
Step 1.3: Document Each Concept Deeply
For each of the 10 concepts, complete this template:
CONCEPT [#]: [Name]

THE CORE INSIGHT:
[One sentence that captures the essential truth—what experts know that beginners don't]

WHY IT WORKS THIS WAY (The Causal Chain):
[Explain the mechanism. Not "X affects Y" but "X affects Y BECAUSE..."]
[Go at least 2 levels deep in the causal chain]

THE COMMON MISCONCEPTION:
[What do most people get wrong about this? What's the intuitive-but-incorrect belief?]

REAL-WORLD APPLICATION (2030s/2040s):
[Specific scenario where a professional would use this concept]
[What decision would they make differently because they understand this?]

THE VARIABLES AT PLAY:
- Input Variable 1: [What can be changed]
- Input Variable 2: [What can be changed]
- Output: [What changes as a result]
- The Relationship: [How inputs affect output and WHY]

EXPERT INTUITION:
[What does an expert "feel" about this concept that a beginner doesn't?]
[What patterns do they recognize instantly?]
Step 1.4: Map the Concept Relationships
Create a concept map showing:
* Which concepts must be understood before others (prerequisites)
* Which concepts reinforce each other (clusters)
* Which concepts have surprising connections
* The optimal learning sequence (not always linear)
Output of Phase 1: A detailed document with 10 deeply-researched concepts, their causal mechanisms, misconceptions, applications, and relationships.

PHASE 2: UNDERSTANDING ARCHITECTURE
Time Investment: Significant | Output: The Learning Blueprint
Design HOW understanding will develop. Map the journey from confusion to clarity.
Step 2.1: Define the Understanding Levels
For each concept, define what understanding looks like at each level:
Level	Description	User Can...
Level 0: Misconception	The intuitive but wrong belief	State the common mistake
Level 1: Awareness	Knows the concept exists	Name it and give basic definition
Level 2: Comprehension	Understands WHAT happens	Describe the relationship accurately
Level 3: Causation	Understands WHY it happens	Explain the mechanism
Level 4: Prediction	Can predict outcomes	Forecast results of new scenarios
Level 5: Application	Can use it to make decisions	Apply to novel real-world situations
Target: Every user reaches Level 4-5 for all 10 concepts.
Step 2.2: Design the Misconception-to-Mastery Arc
For each concept:
LEARNING ARC FOR CONCEPT [#]:

STARTING STATE (What user likely believes):
[The misconception or gap]

COGNITIVE CONFLICT (The "wait, what?" moment):
[The experience/data that challenges their belief]

EXPLORATION (Let them discover):
[What variables they manipulate to see the pattern]

REVELATION (The "aha!" moment):
[How the true mechanism becomes visible]

CONSOLIDATION (Lock in understanding):
[The summary/rule they can articulate]

TRANSFER (Prove they got it):
[New scenario where they apply the concept successfully]
Step 2.3: Sequence the 10 Concepts
Determine the optimal order:
1. Foundation First: Which concepts must come early because others depend on them?
2. Build Complexity: How does each concept add to the previous?
3. Strategic Callbacks: Where should earlier concepts reappear in new contexts?
4. Integration Points: Where do multiple concepts combine?
5. Final Synthesis: How does the last concept tie everything together?
Output of Phase 2: A complete learning architecture with understanding levels, misconception-to-mastery arcs for each concept, and optimal sequencing.

PHASE 3: REAL-WORLD SCENARIO DESIGN
Time Investment: Substantial | Output: 10+ Authentic Scenarios
Every concept must be learned through a scenario that actually happens in the real world. No abstractions. No toy problems.
Step 3.1: Scenario Authenticity Checklist
Every scenario must pass ALL of these tests:
Test	Question
Real Stakes	Would a real person face actual consequences from this decision?
Authentic Numbers	Are all values realistic? (Research actual ranges)
True Options	Are these the actual choices available in real life?
Accurate Outcomes	Do the results match what would actually happen?
Current Relevance	Would this scenario exist in the 2030s/2040s?
Professional Recognition	Would an expert say "Yes, this is exactly what it's like"?
Step 3.2: Scenario Design Template
For each concept, design a scenario:
SCENARIO FOR CONCEPT [#]:

THE SITUATION:
[Who is the user in this scenario? What's their role?]
[What's the context? What's at stake?]

THE DECISION:
[What specific choice(s) must they make?]
[What variables can they control?]

THE CONSTRAINT:
[What makes this non-trivial? What's the tradeoff?]

THE VISIBLE FEEDBACK:
[What changes in the world when they act?]
[How is cause-and-effect made visible?]

THE HIDDEN MECHANISM (What they'll discover):
[What underlying principle explains the outcomes?]

REALISTIC DETAILS:
- Setting: [Specific, vivid, believable]
- Numbers: [Research-backed, realistic ranges]
- Terminology: [What professionals actually call things]
- Tools: [What interfaces/dashboards/controls exist in real life]
Step 3.3: Vary the Contexts
Ensure the 10 scenarios span different contexts to show concept transferability:
* Different industries/domains where the concept applies
* Different scales (individual, team, organization, society)
* Different time horizons (immediate, short-term, long-term effects)
* Different stakeholders affected
Output of Phase 3: 10+ fully-designed, authentic scenarios with realistic details, accurate numbers, and clear decision points.

PHASE 4: WHY-TEACHING MECHANICS
Time Investment: Critical | Output: Interaction Designs That Reveal Causation
This is where good games become great. Design interactions that force the user to confront the WHY.
Step 4.1: The Prediction-Action-Revelation Loop
Every core interaction follows this pattern:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. PREDICT                                                 │
│     "What do you think will happen if you [action]?"        │
│     User commits to a prediction (makes thinking visible)    │
│                                                             │
│  2. ACT                                                     │
│     User manipulates the variable                           │
│     (Slider, choice, drag, toggle)                          │
│                                                             │
│  3. OBSERVE                                                 │
│     Immediate visual feedback shows the result              │
│     Before state → After state (side by side or animated)   │
│                                                             │
│  4. COMPARE                                                 │
│     Show: Your prediction vs. Actual result                 │
│     If wrong: Cognitive conflict created                     │
│     If right: Confidence reinforced                         │
│                                                             │
│  5. REVEAL THE WHY                                          │
│     "This happened BECAUSE [mechanism]"                      │
│     Visual showing the causal chain                         │
│     The underlying principle made explicit                  │
│                                                             │
│  6. ARTICULATE                                              │
│     User completes: "[Variable] affects [Outcome]           │
│     because [Mechanism]"                                    │
│     (Multiple choice or fill-in to verify understanding)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Step 4.2: Making Causation Visible
Design specific visualizations that show WHY, not just WHAT:
Instead of...	Show...
"Revenue decreased"	The FLOW: Price ↑ → Some customers leave → Fewer sales → Revenue changes
"Efficiency improved"	The MECHANISM: Automation → Fewer manual steps → Less time per unit → More output
"Risk increased"	The CHAIN: Variable changed → Exposure increased → More scenarios cause loss
For each concept, define:
CAUSATION VISUALIZATION FOR CONCEPT [#]:

THE SURFACE EFFECT (What's easy to see):
[The outcome that changes]

THE HIDDEN MECHANISM (What must be revealed):
[The causal chain that explains it]

VISUALIZATION APPROACH:
[How will you make the mechanism visible?]
- Flow diagram that animates?
- Intermediate variables that become visible?
- Side-by-side comparison of the "engine"?
- Slow-motion replay of the causal chain?
Step 4.3: Misconception Confrontation
For each concept's common misconception, design a specific moment that challenges it:
MISCONCEPTION CONFRONTATION FOR CONCEPT [#]:

THE MISCONCEPTION:
[What users wrongly believe]

THE SETUP:
[Scenario where the misconception would predict outcome A]

THE REVEAL:
[Reality shows outcome B instead]

THE EXPLANATION:
[Why reality differs from intuition]
[The correct mental model]
Step 4.4: Transfer Challenges
Design scenarios where users apply understanding to novel situations:
TRANSFER CHALLENGE FOR CONCEPT [#]:

FAMILIAR CONTEXT (from learning):
[The original scenario where they learned the concept]

NOVEL CONTEXT (for transfer):
[A different domain/situation with the same underlying principle]

THE BRIDGE:
[What's the same? What's different?]
[How should they recognize this is the same concept?]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
[How do we know they truly understood, not just memorized?]
Output of Phase 4: Detailed interaction designs for each concept showing exactly how causation will be revealed, misconceptions confronted, and understanding transferred.

PHASE 5: GAME FLOW & USER EXPERIENCE
Time Investment: Detailed | Output: Complete Screen-by-Screen Specification
Now design the actual user journey through the game.
Step 5.1: The Master Structure
GAME STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:

Total Concepts: 10
Screens per Concept: 4-8 (depending on complexity)
Total Screens: 40-80
Estimated Play Time: 30-60 minutes

CONCEPT SEQUENCE:
1. [Concept Name] - [# screens] - [Foundation/builds on what]
2. [Concept Name] - [# screens] - [Foundation/builds on what]
...
10. [Concept Name] - [# screens] - [Synthesis of all]

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- After Concept 3: [Mini-challenge combining 1-3]
- After Concept 6: [Mid-game synthesis]
- After Concept 10: [Final integration challenge]
Step 5.2: Screen-by-Screen Specification
For EVERY screen, complete this template:
SCREEN [#]: [Title]
Concept: [Which of the 10]
Purpose: [Hook/Teach/Practice/Test/Synthesize]

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  VISUAL LAYOUT                                              │
│  [Sketch or description of what user sees]                  │
│  - What's the focal point?                                  │
│  - What interactive element exists?                         │
│  - What feedback mechanisms are visible?                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

THE ONE ACTION:
[Exactly what the user does on this screen]

THE ONE LEARNING GOAL:
[The single micro-concept this screen teaches]

BEFORE STATE:
[What the world looks like before user acts]

AFTER STATE:
[What changes after user acts]

THE WHY (shown to user):
[How causation is revealed]

INSTRUCTION TEXT:
[Exact words shown to user - max 10 words]

FEEDBACK TEXT:
[Exact words shown after action - max 15 words]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
[How does game know user succeeded?]

NEXT SCREEN TRIGGER:

Step 5.3: Instruction Clarity Protocol
Every instruction must pass the "5-Second Kid Test":
* Can a 10-year-old understand what to do within 5 seconds?
* Is the action obvious without reading?
* Is there only ONE thing to do?
Instruction writing rules:
Rule	Example
Start with verb	"Drag the slider..."
Max 8 words	"Drag the price slider. Watch what happens."
No jargon first time	Introduce terms AFTER they're understood
Show, don't tell	Animate the expected action if complex
Step 5.4: Feedback Quality Standards
Every piece of feedback must:
* Appear within 100ms of action
* Show WHAT changed (visual)
* Explain WHY it changed (1 sentence)
* Connect to the larger concept (subtle callback)
FEEDBACK TEMPLATE:

VISUAL CHANGE:
[What animates/updates/moves]

QUANTITATIVE FEEDBACK:
[Numbers that change: "Customers: 100 → 72"]

QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK:
[Meaning of change: "Fewer customers at higher price"]

WHY STATEMENT:
[Causal explanation: "Because price-sensitive customers won't pay $12"]

Can user answer:
□ WHAT happens when [variable] changes? (Comprehension)
□ WHY does this happen? (Causation)
□ What would happen in [new scenario]? (Prediction)
□ How would you apply this to [real decision]? (Application)

The WHY test:
□ Is the causal mechanism explicitly shown?
□ Is it shown visually, not just stated?
□ Does user articulate the mechanism themselves?

The Transfer test:
□ Is there a novel scenario for this concept?
□ Can user succeed without hints?
□ Would they recognize this pattern in real life?
Step 7.3: Usability Validation
