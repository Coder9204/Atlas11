You are running in unattended batch mode.

OVERVIEW:
Each ACCOUNTING & FINANCE game is processed in 8 micro-phases:
- Phase 1: Research & Design (analyze, plan 10 concepts, design scenarios)
- Phase 2a1: Infrastructure (add prediction state and helpers)
- Phase 2a2: Concepts 1-3 (implement screens for first 3 concepts)
- Phase 2a3: Concepts 4-5 (implement screens for concepts 4-5)
- Phase 2b1: Concepts 6-8 (implement screens for concepts 6-8)
- Phase 2b2: Concepts 9-10 + Scenarios (final concepts + real-world scenarios)
- Phase 2b3: Visual Polish (progress bar, transitions, mastery summary)
- Phase 3: Testing & Polish (validate, fix issues, finalize)

Hard rules:
- You will be asked to process exactly ONE game, ONE phase at a time.
- Only edit the content in components/GeneratedDiagram.tsx.
- Only edit the code for the specified ACCOUNTING & FINANCE game.
- You must NOT modify unrelated games/graphics.
- Each micro-phase is FOCUSED - do only what that phase specifies.

Selection rule (critical):
- You will be given a specific GAME NAME and PHASE NUMBER to process.
- Focus ONLY on that game and phase.
- Do not process other games or skip ahead to later phases.

Phase-specific behavior:
- Phase 1: Add ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block, do NOT change game logic
- Phase 2a1: Add state variables and helper functions ONLY
- Phase 2a2: Implement concepts 1-3 screens ONLY
- Phase 2a3: Implement concepts 4-5 screens ONLY
- Phase 2b1: Implement concepts 6-8 screens ONLY
- Phase 2b2: Implement concepts 9-10 + 2 scenario screens ONLY
- Phase 2b3: Add visual polish (progress bar, transitions, summary) ONLY
- Phase 3: Test and fix issues, update comment to show complete

Accuracy requirement:
- Work carefully: understand the selected game's current state
- Apply the phase prompt precisely to that game only
- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly improving it
- Each phase builds on the previous - don't redo earlier work

Verification:
- Run: bash scripts/run_checks.sh
- If checks fail, fix only within the selected game and retry checks.
- If checks cannot pass without touching other games, revert and FAIL.

Output contract (single line only at the END of your response):
- On success: DONE <GAME_NAME> PHASE <PHASE_NUMBER>
- On failure (after reverting): FAIL <GAME_NAME> PHASE <PHASE_NUMBER>

Example outputs:
- DONE AccountingEquationRenderer PHASE 1
- DONE AccountingEquationRenderer PHASE 2a1
- DONE AccountingEquationRenderer PHASE 2a2
- DONE AccountingEquationRenderer PHASE 2a3
- DONE AccountingEquationRenderer PHASE 2b1
- DONE AccountingEquationRenderer PHASE 2b2
- DONE AccountingEquationRenderer PHASE 2b3
- DONE AccountingEquationRenderer PHASE 3
- FAIL BalanceSheetRenderer PHASE 2a2
