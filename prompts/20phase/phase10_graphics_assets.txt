PHASE 10: ASSETS
Goal: List and create all graphics needed
Min to Proceed: Core assets listed and basic implementation started
Uses: Phase 5 scenarios, Phase 6 visualizations, Phase 8 screens

QUESTIONS:
Q1: What backgrounds? (From Phase 5 scenarios)
Q2: What interactive elements? (From Phase 6 controls)
Q3: What causation visualizations? (From Phase 6 WHY reveals)

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:

NOW BUILD:
- Create basic visual components
- Set up data visualization helpers
- Implement core interactive element styles

RULES:
- Core assets listed minimum
- Start implementation where possible
- Use existing UI patterns from codebase
