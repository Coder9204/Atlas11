PHASE 10 OF 20: GRAPHICS & ASSET PLANNING
==========================================
Time Investment: Quality-Focused | Output: Asset Inventory + Implementation

Plan and implement all visual assets. Everything must be realistic and professional.

REALISM STANDARDS:
-----------------
- Graphics look realistic, not cartoonish or clip-art
- High-resolution, crisp, professional
- Every image supports learning (no decorative filler)
- Consistent style throughout

WHAT TO AVOID vs WHAT TO USE:
-----------------------------
AVOID: Clip art, cartoonish characters, flat childish icons
USE: Professional graphics, elegant illustrations, refined icons

ASSET CATEGORIES TO IMPLEMENT:
------------------------------

1. SCENARIO GRAPHICS
   - Background environments (realistic settings)
   - Objects relevant to scenarios
   - Visual representations of abstract concepts

2. DATA VISUALIZATIONS
   - Charts and graphs (clean, modern style)
   - Meters and indicators
   - Progress displays
   - Before/after comparisons

3. ICONS
   - Consistent stroke weight
   - Clear meaning
   - Multiple sizes if needed

4. INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS
   - Buttons (primary, secondary states)
   - Sliders (track, handle, fill)
   - Cards (containers for information)
   - Input controls

CONCEPT VISUAL MAPPING:
-----------------------
Every abstract concept gets ONE consistent visual:
- Money/Budget: Green + dollar icon + meter
- Growth: Upward arrow + green
- Loss/Danger: Red + downward indicator
- Time: Clock/timeline
- Success: Gold star/check
