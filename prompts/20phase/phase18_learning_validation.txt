PHASE 18 OF 20: LEARNING VALIDATION
====================================
Time Investment: Thorough | Output: Verified Educational Effectiveness

Verify the game actually teaches what it's supposed to teach.

CONCEPT-BY-CONCEPT CHECK:
------------------------
For EACH of the 10 concepts, verify:

COMPREHENSION TEST:
After completing this concept's screens, can user answer:
- WHAT happens when [variable] changes? (Level 2)
- WHY does this happen? (Level 3)
- What would happen in [new scenario]? (Level 4)
- How would you apply this to [real decision]? (Level 5)

THE WHY TEST:
- Is the causal mechanism explicitly shown?
- Is it shown VISUALLY, not just text?
- Does user articulate the mechanism (via interaction)?
- Is the misconception directly confronted?

THE PREDICTION TEST:
- Does user make predictions?
- Are predictions compared to results?
- Is the gap explained?

THE TRANSFER TEST:
- Is there a novel scenario?
- Can user succeed without hints?
- Is context different enough to prove transfer?

INTEGRATION LEARNING CHECK:
--------------------------

After Checkpoint 1 (Concepts 1-3):
- Do concepts work together?
- Is combined challenge achievable?

After Checkpoint 2 (Concepts 1-6):
- Can user apply multiple concepts?
- Are callbacks to earlier concepts clear?

Final Integration (All 10):
- Does user demonstrate comprehensive understanding?
- Can they handle multi-concept decisions?

THE ULTIMATE TEST:
-----------------
After completing the game, user should be able to:
1. NAME all 10 core concepts
2. EXPLAIN how each works (the mechanism)
3. PREDICT outcomes in new scenarios
4. APPLY the concepts to real decisions
5. TEACH the concepts to someone else

FIX any gaps in learning before proceeding.
