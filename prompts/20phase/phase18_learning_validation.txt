PHASE 18: LEARNING TEST
Goal: Verify game actually teaches
Min to Proceed: 5+ concepts validated as teaching effectively
Uses: Phase 2 concepts, Phase 3 arcs, Phase 6 mechanics

PER-CONCEPT VALIDATION:

□ User can answer: "What happens when [variable] changes?"
□ User can answer: "WHY does this happen?"
□ User can predict: New scenario correctly
□ Misconception is confronted (Phase 3)
□ Transfer works (different context, same principle)

THE WHY TEST:
□ Causal mechanism explicitly shown (not just stated)
□ Shown VISUALLY, not just in text
□ User articulates mechanism (via interaction)

INTEGRATION CHECK:
□ After Checkpoint 1: Concepts 1-3 work together
□ After Checkpoint 2: Concepts 1-6 combine
□ Final: All 10 concepts synthesize

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:
/*
 * Phase 18: Learning Test
 *
 * CONCEPT VALIDATION:
 * | Concept | What | Why | Predict | Misconception | Transfer |
 * | 1 | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ |
 * | 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
 * [all 10]
 *
 * WHY TEST:
 * - Shown visually: Yes/Partial/No
 * - User articulates: Yes/Partial/No
 *
 * INTEGRATION:
 * - CP1 (1-3): Works/Issues
 * - CP2 (1-6): Works/Issues
 * - Final (all): Works/Issues
 *
 * CARRY FORWARD:
 * - Concepts validated: X/10
 * - For Phase 20: Learning status
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 19
 */

RULES:
- 5+ concepts must validate
- WHY must be shown visually
- Fix learning gaps before proceeding
