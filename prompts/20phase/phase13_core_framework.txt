PHASE 13: FRAMEWORK
Goal: Build navigation and input systems
Min to Proceed: Navigation + inputs work
Uses: Phase 7 structure, Phase 8 navigation, Phase 11 controls

QUESTIONS:
Q1: Does navigation work forward/backward?
Q2: Does state persist?
Q3: Do all controls respond?

BUILD CHECKLIST:

NAVIGATION:
□ Screen container with currentScreen state
□ Progress indicator (dots or step X of Y)
□ Forward/backward buttons
□ Smooth transitions (200-300ms)

STATE:
□ const [currentScreen, setCurrentScreen] = useState(0)
□ User inputs persist across screens
□ Progress tracking (concepts completed)
□ Prediction history saved

INPUTS:
□ Button onClick handlers
□ Slider onChange handlers
□ Choice selection handlers
□ All respond <100ms

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:
/*
 * Phase 13: Framework
 *
 * NAVIGATION:
 * - Screen state: [implemented/not]
 * - Progress indicator: [implemented/not]
 * - Forward/back: [implemented/not]
 * - Transitions: [implemented/not]
 *
 * STATE:
 * - Current screen: useState hook
 * - User inputs: [how stored]
 * - Progress: [how tracked]
 *
 * INPUTS:
 * - Button handlers: [implemented/not]
 * - Slider handlers: [implemented/not]
 * - Choice handlers: [implemented/not]
 *
 * CARRY FORWARD:
 * - Navigation: Works/Partial
 * - State: Works/Partial
 * - Inputs: Works/Partial
 * - For Phase 14: Framework ready to build into
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 14
 */

NOW BUILD:
- Add useState for currentScreen
- Add navigation functions (nextScreen, prevScreen)
- Add progress indicator component
- Add input handlers
- Test forward/backward navigation works

RULES:
- Navigation must work
- Inputs must respond
- State must persist
