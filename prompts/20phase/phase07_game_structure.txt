PHASE 7 OF 20: GAME STRUCTURE ARCHITECTURE
===========================================
Time Investment: Detailed | Output: Master Game Structure

Design the overall game structure before specifying individual screens.

SCREEN TYPES TO USE:
-------------------
| Type | Purpose | Duration |
|------|---------|----------|
| Hook | Capture attention, show stakes | 10-15 sec |
| Goal | Establish what user is trying to achieve | 10-15 sec |
| Teach | Introduce concept with guided interaction | 20-30 sec |
| Practice | Repeat with variation | 15-20 sec |
| Predict | User commits to prediction | 10-15 sec |
| Reveal | Show result and explain WHY | 15-20 sec |
| Challenge | Test understanding | 20-30 sec |
| Transfer | Apply to new context | 20-30 sec |
| Integrate | Combine multiple concepts | 30-45 sec |
| Takeaway | Summarize learning | 15-20 sec |

THE CORE LOOP (For each concept):
---------------------------------
TRY -> FEEDBACK -> REWARD -> TRY AGAIN (slightly harder)

STANDARD CONCEPT SEQUENCE (8-10 screens per concept):
----------------------------------------------------
1. HOOK - Shows world + stakes
2. GOAL - One sentence goal + visual of success
3. GUIDED FIRST MOVE - Highlight control, animate gesture
4. IMMEDIATE RESULT - World changes, short "why"
5-7. PRACTICE LOOP - Same concept, varied, 3 reps
8. PREDICT + REVEAL - Prediction vs result + mechanism
9. TRANSFER - New context, same concept
10. CONCEPT TAKEAWAY - Visual summary + real-life rule

THE 70/20/10 RULE:
-----------------
70% - Interactive Visuals (game world, manipulable elements)
20% - Explanatory Graphics (charts, arrows, indicators)
10% - Text (3-6 word labels, "because" statements)
