PHASE 7: GAME STRUCTURE
Goal: Calculate screens, timing, flow
Min to Proceed: Total screens estimated, 5+ concepts structured
Uses: Phase 4 sequence, Phase 6 mechanics

QUESTIONS:
Q1: How many screens per concept? (Base: Hook + Teach×2-3 + Practice×2 + Reveal + Transfer = ~7-9)
Q2: Is total time 30-60 minutes? (Screens × 20 sec average)
Q3: Does 70/20/10 hold? (70% interactive, 20% graphics, 10% text)

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:
/*
 * Phase 7: Game Structure
 *
 * STRUCTURE:
 * Pos 1: [Concept] - [X] screens - [Y] min
 * Pos 2: [Concept] - [X] screens - [Y] min
 * Pos 3: [Concept] - [X] screens - [Y] min
 * CP1: Checkpoint - [X] screens - Combines 1-3
 * Pos 4-6: [concepts with screen counts]
 * CP2: Checkpoint - [X] screens - Combines 1-6
 * Pos 7-10: [concepts with screen counts]
 * FINAL: Synthesis - [X] screens
 *
 * TOTALS:
 * - Total screens: [X]
 * - Total time: [X] min
 * - Balance: [X]% interactive / [Y]% graphics / [Z]% text
 *
 * CARRY FORWARD:
 * - Concepts structured: X/10
 * - For Phase 8: Screen list to specify
 * - For Phase 13: Navigation structure
 * - For Phase 14: Build order
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 8
 */

RULES:
- Estimate total screens
- 5+ concepts structured = ready to proceed
- Target 30-60 min total playtime
