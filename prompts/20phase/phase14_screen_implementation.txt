PHASE 14: BUILD SCREENS
Goal: Implement all screens
Min to Proceed: 5+ concepts fully built and working
Uses: ALL Phases 1-13

BUILD ORDER (per Phase 4 sequence):
For each concept:
1. Hook screen → 2. Teach screens → 3. Practice screens → 4. Reveal screen → 5. Transfer screen
6. TEST concept before moving to next

PER-SCREEN BUILD CHECKLIST:
□ Layout matches Phase 8 spec
□ ONE action works (Phase 8 Q1)
□ ONE learning goal shown (Phase 8 Q2)
□ Feedback appears <100ms
□ WHY shown for reveal screens (Phase 6)
□ Navigation works (Phase 13)
□ Content displays (Phase 12)
□ Styling applied (Phase 9)

SCREEN IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:
```
// Screen array structure
const screens = [
  { concept: 1, type: 'hook', ... },
  { concept: 1, type: 'teach', ... },
  ...
];

// Render based on currentScreen
const renderScreen = () => {
  const screen = screens[currentScreen];
  switch(screen.type) {
    case 'hook': return <HookScreen {...screen} />;
    case 'teach': return <TeachScreen {...screen} />;
    ...
  }
};
```

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:
/*
 * Phase 14: Build Screens
 *
 * CONCEPT 1: [Name] - [X/Y screens built]
 * - Hook: Done/Partial
 * - Teach 1-3: Done/Partial
 * - Practice 1-2: Done/Partial
 * - Reveal: Done/Partial
 * - Transfer: Done/Partial
 * - TESTED: Yes/No
 *
 * [Repeat for all concepts]
 *
 * CARRY FORWARD:
 * - Screens built: X/total
 * - Concepts complete: X/10
 * - For Phase 15: Screens to polish
 * - For Phase 16: Screens to integrate
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 15
 */

RULES:
- Build in sequence order (Phase 4)
- Test each concept before next
- 5+ concepts fully working = ready to proceed
