PHASE 14 OF 20: SCREEN-BY-SCREEN IMPLEMENTATION
================================================
Time Investment: Extensive | Output: All Screens Built

Build each screen according to Phase 8 specifications.

BUILD SEQUENCE (For each concept):
---------------------------------
1. Build HOOK screen -> Test navigation
2. Build TEACH screens (3-5) -> Test interaction + feedback
3. Build PRACTICE screens (2-3) -> Test variation
4. Build PREDICT + REVEAL screen -> Test causation visualization
5. Build TRANSFER screen -> Test new context
6. Build TAKEAWAY screen -> Test summary display
7. INTEGRATION TEST for concept -> Play through, verify learning arc

SCREEN IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:
-------------------------------
For EACH screen, verify before moving on:

VISUAL:
- Layout matches specification
- Focal point is clearly prominent
- White space is generous
- Colors match design system
- Graphics are high-quality

INTERACTION:
- The ONE action works correctly
- Interactive element is obviously interactive
- Feedback appears within 100ms
- State updates correctly

CONTENT:
- Instruction text is present and clear
- Labels are readable
- Feedback displays correctly
- WHY statement included

NAVIGATION:
- Previous screen links correctly
- Next screen links correctly
- CTA appears at right time
- Progress indicator accurate

BUILD NOW:
----------
Implement ALL screens for ALL 10 concepts following specs from Phase 8.

Each screen should have:
- Unique content based on its concept
- The ONE action specified
- The ONE learning goal
- Proper state management
- Correct navigation flow

Use switch/case or array mapping:

const screens = [
  { type: 'hook', concept: 1, content: {...} },
  { type: 'teach', concept: 1, content: {...} },
  // ... all screens
];

const renderScreen = () => {
  const screen = screens[currentScreen];
  // Render based on screen type and content
};
