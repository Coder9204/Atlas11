PHASE 4: SEQUENCE
Goal: Determine optimal learning order
Min to Proceed: First 5 positions confident
Uses: Phase 2 relationships, Phase 3 dependencies

QUESTIONS:
Q1: Which concepts have NO prerequisites? (These go first)
Q2: Which concepts REQUIRE others first?
Q3: Where should concepts combine for deeper insight?

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:
/*
 * Phase 4: Sequence
 *
 * LEARNING ORDER:
 * Pos 1: [Concept] - Foundation - Confidence: H/M/L
 * Pos 2: [Concept] - Builds on 1 - Confidence: H/M/L
 * Pos 3: [Concept] - Builds on 1,2 - Confidence: H/M/L
 * CP1: Checkpoint - Integrates 1-3
 * Pos 4: [Concept] - Prereqs: [list]
 * Pos 5: [Concept] - Prereqs: [list]
 * Pos 6: [Concept] - Prereqs: [list]
 * CP2: Checkpoint - Integrates 1-6
 * Pos 7-10: [remaining concepts]
 * FINAL: Synthesis - All concepts
 *
 * CARRY FORWARD:
 * - Positions confident: X/10
 * - Integration points: X/3
 * - For Phase 5: Build scenarios in this order
 * - For Phase 7: This is the game backbone
 * - For Phase 14: Build in this sequence
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 5
 */

RULES:
- First 5 positions must be confident
- Positions 6-10 can be provisional
- Include 2-3 integration checkpoints
