PHASE 4 OF 20: CONCEPT SEQUENCING & RELATIONSHIPS
==================================================
Time Investment: Moderate | Output: Optimal Learning Sequence + Concept Map

Determine the optimal order for teaching concepts and how they relate.

FOR EACH CONCEPT, IDENTIFY:
---------------------------
1. PREREQUISITES: What must be understood first? Why?
2. ENABLES: What concepts become clearer after this? Why?
3. REINFORCES: What concepts are mutually reinforcing?
4. INTEGRATES WITH: What concepts combine for deeper insight?

SEQUENCING PRINCIPLES:
---------------------
1. Foundation First - Which concepts must come early?
2. Build Complexity - How does each add to previous?
3. Strategic Callbacks - Where should earlier concepts reappear?
4. Integration Points - Where do multiple concepts combine?
5. Final Synthesis - How does the last concept tie everything?

 * ENHANCEMENT PLAN - [GAME NAME]
 * Phase 4 Complete: Concept Sequencing

 * [Keep Phase 1-3 content]
 *
 * OPTIMAL SEQUENCE:
 * 1. [Concept] - FOUNDATION - Why first: [reason]
 * 2. [Concept] - Builds on #1 - Why here: [reason]
 * 3. [Concept] - Builds on #1,2 - Why here: [reason]
 * ... (all 10 in order)

 * INTEGRATION CHECKPOINTS:
 * - After Concept 3: Mini-challenge combining 1-3
 * - After Concept 6: Mid-point synthesis
 * - After Concept 10: Final integration challenge
