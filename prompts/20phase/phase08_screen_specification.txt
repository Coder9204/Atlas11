PHASE 8 OF 20: SCREEN-BY-SCREEN SPECIFICATION
==============================================
Time Investment: Extensive | Output: Detailed Spec for Every Screen

Specify every single screen in detail. This is the blueprint for building.

SCREEN ANATOMY STANDARD:
------------------------
| Section | Height | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|
| TOP | 50px | Progress indicator (dots, step X of Y) |
| CENTER | 400px | Play Area - ONE focal point, ONE interaction |
| BOTTOM | 50px | Single CTA button (appears after action) |

FOR EACH SCREEN, SPECIFY:
-------------------------

1. METADATA
   - Concept number
   - Screen type (Hook/Teach/Practice/etc.)
   - Purpose (what this screen accomplishes)
   - Duration (expected time on screen)

2. VISUAL LAYOUT
   - Focal Point: What draws the eye
   - Interactive Element: What user can manipulate
   - Feedback Display: Where results show

3. THE ONE ACTION
   - What user does (exactly one thing)
   - Control type (Slider/Button/Drag/Toggle/Choice)

4. THE ONE LEARNING GOAL
   - Micro-concept (single "because" idea)
   - By end of screen, user understands: [specific thing]

5. STATE CHANGES
   - BEFORE STATE: What user sees before acting
   - USER ACTION: What they do
   - AFTER STATE: What changes and how

6. TEXT CONTENT (Minimal!)
   - Instruction: Max 8 words
   - Feedback: Max 15 words
   - Why statement: Max 12 words
