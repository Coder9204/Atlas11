PHASE 2 OF 20: CONCEPT DEEP-DIVE DOCUMENTATION
===============================================
Time Investment: Substantial | Output: Detailed Concept Cards

For each of the 10 concepts from Phase 1, create comprehensive documentation.

FOR EACH CONCEPT, DOCUMENT:
---------------------------

1. THE CORE INSIGHT
   One sentence that captures the essential truth - what experts know that beginners don't

2. WHY IT WORKS THIS WAY (The Causal Chain)
   - Level 1 Cause: The immediate reason ("X happens because Y")
   - Level 2 Cause: Why Level 1 is true ("Y happens because Z")
   - The Complete Chain: Full cause-effect sequence

3. THE COMMON MISCONCEPTION
   - What Beginners Believe: The intuitive-but-incorrect belief
   - Why It Seems True: Why this misconception is appealing
   - The Critical Error: What specific thing they get wrong
   - The Correction: The accurate mental model

4. REAL-WORLD APPLICATION
   - Professional Context: Who uses this? What role? What industry?
   - Specific Decision: What exact decision does this inform?
   - Without This Knowledge: What mistake would they make?
   - With This Knowledge: What better decision would they make?

5. THE VARIABLES AT PLAY
   - Input Variable 1: Name, range, what user can manipulate
   - Input Variable 2: Name, range, what user can manipulate
   - Output Variable: What it is, how it changes, why it matters
   - The Relationship: How inputs affect output
