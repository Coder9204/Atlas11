PHASE 6: WHY-TEACHING MECHANICS
Goal: Design interactions that reveal causation
Min to Proceed: 5+ concepts with prediction loop designed
Uses: Phase 2 chains, Phase 3 arcs, Phase 5 scenarios

PER CONCEPT, DESIGN:
Q1: What prediction exposes their misconception? (What will they answer wrong?)
Q2: What control causes the change? (Slider/Choice/Drag from Phase 2 variables)
Q3: How do we visualize the causal chain? (Show WHY, not just WHAT)
Q4: What statement proves understanding? ("[Input] affects [Output] because [Mechanism]")

THE PREDICTION LOOP:
1. PREDICT: "What happens if [action]?" - Options include misconception answer
2. ACT: Control type, what it adjusts, range from Phase 5
3. OBSERVE: Before → After, surprise if prediction wrong
4. REVEAL WHY: Visualization method + "Because [chain]"
5. ARTICULATE: User completes "[___] affects [___] because [___]"

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:
/*
 * Phase 6: WHY-Teaching Mechanics
 *
 * MECHANIC 1: [Concept Name]
 * - Predict: "What happens if [X]?" Options: [A/B/C]
 * - Act: [Control type] adjusts [variable], range [X-Y]
 * - Observe: Before [state] → After [state]
 * - Reveal: [Visualization: flow/step/compare] "Because [chain]"
 * - Articulate: "[___] affects [___] because [___]"
 * - Status: Complete / Loop only / Partial
 *
 * [Repeat for all concepts]
 *
 * CARRY FORWARD:
 * - Complete mechanics: X/10
 * - Loop only: X/10
 * - For Phase 7: Screen types per concept
 * - For Phase 8: Interaction details
 * - For Phase 10: Visualizations needed
 * - For Phase 11: Control types list
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 7
 */

RULES:
- Prediction loop (steps 1-4) minimum
- Step 5 can be partial
- 5+ with loop = ready to proceed
