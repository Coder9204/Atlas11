PHASE 6 OF 20: WHY-TEACHING MECHANICS DESIGN
=============================================
Time Investment: Critical | Output: Interaction Designs for Each Concept

This is where good games become great. Design interactions that force users to confront the WHY.

THE PREDICTION-ACTION-REVELATION LOOP (Core Pattern):
----------------------------------------------------
1. PREDICT: "What do you think will happen?" - User commits to prediction
2. ACT: User manipulates the variable
3. OBSERVE: Immediate visual feedback shows result
4. COMPARE: Show prediction vs. actual result
5. REVEAL THE WHY: "This happened BECAUSE [mechanism]"
6. ARTICULATE: User completes "[Variable] affects [Outcome] because [Mechanism]"

FOR EACH CONCEPT, DESIGN:
-------------------------

1. CAUSATION VISUALIZATION
   - The Surface Effect: What's easy to see (the WHAT)
   - The Hidden Mechanism: What must be revealed (the WHY)
   - Visualization Method: How to make the WHY visible
     Options: Flow diagram, intermediate variables, side-by-side,
              slow-motion, layered reveal, before/after

2. MISCONCEPTION CONFRONTATION
   - The Setup: Scenario where misconception predicts outcome A
   - The Reveal: Reality shows outcome B instead
   - The Cognitive Conflict: The "wait, that doesn't make sense" moment
   - The Explanation: Why reality differs from intuition
   - The Resolution: The "of course!" moment

3. TRANSFER CHALLENGE
   - Familiar Context: Where they learned the concept
   - Novel Context: Different domain, same principle
   - The Bridge: Recognition cue connecting them
   - Success Proof: How we know they truly understood
