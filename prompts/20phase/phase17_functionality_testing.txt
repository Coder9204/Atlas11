PHASE 17 OF 20: FUNCTIONALITY TESTING
======================================
Time Investment: Thorough | Output: Bug-Free, Stable Game

A broken game teaches nothing. Test everything systematically.

FULL PLAYTHROUGH TEST:
---------------------
- Play through ENTIRE game start to finish
- Test EVERY button, slider, toggle, interactive element
- Verify EVERY screen transition
- Confirm NO blank screens, white screens, broken states
- Ensure game NEVER requires refresh to continue
- Check all animations complete properly
- Verify all feedback appears correctly

SCREEN-BY-SCREEN VERIFICATION:
-----------------------------
For EACH screen:
- Screen loads completely with all elements
- Interactive elements respond to input
- Feedback appears within 100ms
- State updates correctly
- Transition to next screen works
- No console errors
- No visual glitches

EDGE CASE TESTING:
-----------------

RAPID INTERACTION:
- Click buttons multiple times rapidly
- Rapid slider movement
- Quick screen changes

EXTREME VALUES:
- Slider at minimum
- Slider at maximum
- Boundary conditions

NAVIGATION STRESS:
- Navigate backwards and forwards repeatedly
- Return to earlier screens
- Jump around if possible

IDLE/TIMEOUT:
- Leave game idle, return
- Long pause between actions

UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Complete actions in unexpected order
- Interact before screen fully loads
- Click outside interactive areas

COMMON FAILURES TO FIX:
----------------------
| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Blank screen | Ensure components render, data loads |
| Frozen state | Verify all handlers connected |
| Missing content | Ensure data loads before render |
| Broken navigation | Verify all buttons link correctly |
| Unresponsive controls | Verify handlers on all elements |

FIX ALL ISSUES before proceeding.
