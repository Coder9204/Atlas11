PHASE 11: CONTROLS
Goal: Define and implement interaction behaviors
Min to Proceed: Control types + ranges defined, basic handlers implemented
Uses: Phase 6 mechanics, Phase 8 controls, Phase 9 components

QUESTIONS:
Q1: What control types? (Sliders, buttons, drags, choices)
Q2: What ranges/options? (From Phase 5 realistic numbers)
Q3: What feedback timing? (<100ms response required)

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:
/*
 * Phase 11: Controls
 *
 * SLIDERS:
 * | Name | Min | Max | Step | Default | Screen | Implemented |
 * | [var] | [X] | [Y] | [Z] | [D] | [#] | Yes/No |
 *
 * BUTTONS:
 * | Name | Action | Size | Screen | Implemented |
 * | [name] | [what happens] | 48px+ | [#] | Yes/No |
 *
 * CHOICES:
 * | Name | Options | Screen | Implemented |
 * | [name] | [A/B/C] | [#] | Yes/No |
 *
 * TIMING:
 * - Response: <100ms
 * - Animations: 60fps
 * - Feedback: immediate visual change
 *
 * CARRY FORWARD:
 * - Sliders defined: X, implemented: Y
 * - Buttons defined: X, implemented: Y
 * - Choices defined: X, implemented: Y
 * - For Phase 13: Input handlers
 * - For Phase 14: Control implementation
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 12
 */

NOW BUILD:
- Add slider components with proper ranges
- Add button handlers
- Add choice/selection components
- Ensure <100ms response times

RULES:
- Types + ranges minimum
- Start implementing handlers
- All controls must have 48px+ touch targets
