PHASE 12 OF 20: CONTENT WRITING
================================
Time Investment: Careful | Output: All Text Content Implemented

Write and implement every piece of text in the game. Less is more.

THE 10% TEXT RULE:
-----------------
Text is only 10% of content. Every word must earn its place.

MAXIMUM LENGTHS:
---------------
- Instructions: 8 words max
- Feedback: 15 words max
- Why statements: 12 words max
- Labels: 6 words max
- Takeaways: 20 words max

WRITING PRINCIPLES:
------------------
- Start with verb for instructions ("Drag...", "Click...", "Choose...")
- Lead with the learning for feedback
- "Because" statements explain mechanism
- No jargon until concept is understood
- Friendly, not clinical

TONE GUIDELINES:
---------------
| Situation | DON'T Say | DO Say |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Correct | "Correct!" | "Yes! Because [mechanism]" |
| Incorrect | "Wrong" | "Not quite. Watch [element]" |
| Encourage | "Good job" | "You discovered: [insight]!" |
| Complete | "You finished" | "You now understand: [takeaway]" |

FOR EACH SCREEN, WRITE:
-----------------------
1. Instruction text (if needed) - Max 8 words
2. Labels for elements - Max 6 words each
3. Feedback for success - Include WHY
4. Feedback for "not quite" - Include hint
5. Why statement - "Because [mechanism]"
6. CTA button text - 2-3 words

LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY:
