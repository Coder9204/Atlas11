PHASE 1 OF 20: EXPERT KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
============================================
Time Investment: Substantial | Output: The 10 Core Concepts List

Before designing anything, become the expert. Research deeply.

STEP 1: ANALYZE EXISTING GAME
-----------------------------
Read the current renderer code and document:
- What concepts does it currently teach?
- What interactive elements exist?
- What feedback mechanisms are in place?
- Current strengths and weaknesses?

STEP 2: EXPERT KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
----------------------------------
Answer these questions:

1. DAILY APPLICATION
   - What do professionals in this field think about daily?
   - What decisions do they make? What variables do they manipulate?
   - What would get them fired if they didn't understand it?

2. EXPERTISE DIFFERENTIATORS
   - What separates a novice from a 10-year veteran?
   - What's the knowledge that cannot be faked?
   - What do experts "see" that beginners miss entirely?

3. FUTURE RELEVANCE (2030s/2040s)
   - Will this knowledge still matter in 15-20 years?
   - What's fundamental vs. what's trendy?

4. DECISION IMPACT
   - What knowledge leads to better decisions?
   - What misunderstandings lead to costly mistakes?

STEP 3: IDENTIFY THE 10 CORE CONCEPTS
-------------------------------------
Each concept must pass ALL criteria:
- Applied Daily: Professional uses this at least weekly
- Causal Understanding: Explains WHY, not just WHAT
- Decision-Relevant: Changes decisions someone makes
- Future-Proof: Still matters in 2040
- Interconnected: Connects to at least 2 other concepts
- Testable: Can verify through prediction/application
- Non-Obvious: Beginners would get this wrong

IMPORTANT:
- Keep concise (under 60 lines)
- Focus on actionable insights
- Do NOT change game logic yet
