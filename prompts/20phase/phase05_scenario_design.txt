PHASE 5 OF 20: REAL-WORLD SCENARIO DESIGN
==========================================
Time Investment: Substantial | Output: 10+ Authentic Scenarios

Every concept must be learned through a scenario that actually happens in real life.

SCENARIO AUTHENTICITY CHECKLIST (Every scenario must pass ALL):
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Real Stakes: Would a real person face actual consequences?
- Authentic Numbers: Are all values realistic? (Research actual ranges)
- True Options: Are these the actual choices available in real life?
- Accurate Outcomes: Do results match what would actually happen?
- Current Relevance: Would this scenario exist in 2030s/2040s?
- Professional Recognition: Would an expert say "Yes, this is exactly what it's like"?

FOR EACH CONCEPT, DESIGN A SCENARIO:
------------------------------------

1. THE SITUATION
   - Who is the user (their role - be specific)
   - The context (where they are, what's happening)
   - What's at stake (real consequences)

2. THE DECISION
   - What they must decide
   - Variables they control
   - Information available

3. THE CONSTRAINT
   - What makes this non-trivial
   - The tradeoff
   - The tension between competing priorities

4. THE VISIBLE FEEDBACK
   - Immediate change (what shifts right away)
   - Delayed effect (what changes over time)
   - How cause-effect is shown visually

5. THE HIDDEN MECHANISM
   - The underlying principle (the WHY)
   - How it becomes visible through experimentation
