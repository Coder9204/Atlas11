PHASE 5: REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS
Goal: Create authentic situations for each concept
Min to Proceed: 5+ scenarios with Q1-Q3
Uses: Phase 2 variables, Phase 4 sequence

PER CONCEPT, ANSWER:
Q1: What specific situation would a real person face? (Who, stakes, decision)
Q2: What makes this non-obvious? (Tradeoff or tension)
Q3: What realistic numbers apply? (Research actual ranges)
Q4: How does feedback become visible? (Immediate + mechanism)

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:
/*
 * Phase 5: Scenarios
 *
 * SCENARIO 1: [Concept Name] (Position [X])
 * - Who: [role]
 * - Stakes: [what could go wrong]
 * - Decision: [what they choose]
 * - Tradeoff: [competing priorities]
 * - Numbers: [variable]: [realistic range]
 * - Feedback: Immediate [X], Mechanism [Y]
 * - Authenticity: Expert would recognize / Needs validation
 * - Status: Complete / Q1-Q3 / Partial
 *
 * [Repeat for all concepts in sequence order]
 *
 * CARRY FORWARD:
 * - Complete scenarios: X/10
 * - Partial (Q1-Q3): X/10
 * - For Phase 6: Scenario contexts
 * - For Phase 9: Visual settings
 * - For Phase 10: Graphics needed
 * - For Phase 12: Terminology
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 6
 */

RULES:
- Q1-Q3 minimum per scenario
- Q4 can be partial
- 5+ with Q1-Q3 = ready to proceed
