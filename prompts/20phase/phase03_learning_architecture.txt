PHASE 3: LEARNING ARCS
Goal: Map journey from misconception to mastery
Min to Proceed: 5+ concepts with stages 1-4
Uses: Phase 2 misconceptions, causal chains, variables

PER CONCEPT, DESIGN:
Q1: What surprising result challenges their wrong belief?
Q2: What do they manipulate to discover the pattern?
Q3: How does the WHY become visible?
Q4: What rule can they state after learning?

LEARNING ARC STAGES:
1. WRONG BELIEF: They think [Phase 2 misconception], predict [wrong outcome]
2. SURPRISE: [Q1 - unexpected result challenges them]
3. EXPLORE: They try [Phase 2 variables], notice [pattern]
4. REVEAL: They see [Phase 2 causal chain made visible]
5. CONSOLIDATE: They can state [Phase 2 insight as rule]
6. TRANSFER: New context where same principle applies

OUTPUT FORMAT - Update ENHANCEMENT PLAN:
/*
 * Phase 3: Learning Arcs
 *
 * ARC 1: [Concept Name]
 * - Wrong belief: [misconception] → predicts [X]
 * - Surprise: [what challenges them]
 * - Explore: [variables to try]
 * - Reveal: [how WHY shown]
 * - Rule: [what they can state]
 * - Transfer: [new context]
 * - Status: All 6 / 1-4 / Partial
 *
 * [Repeat for all concepts]
 *
 * CARRY FORWARD:
 * - Complete arcs (6 stages): X/10
 * - Partial arcs (1-4): X/10
 * - For Phase 4: Dependencies noticed
 * - For Phase 6: Surprise moments, WHY reveals
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 4
 */

RULES:
- Stages 1-4 minimum
- Stages 5-6 can be partial
- 5+ with stages 1-4 = ready to proceed
