PHASE 3 OF 20: LEARNING ARCHITECTURE DESIGN
============================================
Time Investment: Significant | Output: Understanding Levels + Learning Arcs

Design HOW understanding will develop for each concept.

UNDERSTANDING LEVELS (Apply to each concept):
---------------------------------------------
Level 0: Misconception - The intuitive but wrong belief
Level 1: Awareness - Knows the concept exists
Level 2: Comprehension - Understands WHAT happens
Level 3: Causation - Understands WHY it happens
Level 4: Prediction - Can predict outcomes in new scenarios
Level 5: Application - Can use it to make real decisions

TARGET: Every user reaches Level 4-5 for all 10 concepts.

FOR EACH CONCEPT, DESIGN THE LEARNING ARC:
------------------------------------------

1. STARTING STATE (Level 0)
   - What user likely believes (the misconception)
   - Why they believe it

2. COGNITIVE CONFLICT (The "wait, what?" moment)
   - The experience that challenges their belief
   - The data/result that doesn't match expectation

3. EXPLORATION (Level 1-2)
   - What they manipulate
   - What patterns they observe

4. REVELATION (Level 3 - The "aha!" moment)
   - How the WHY is revealed
   - The new understanding

5. CONSOLIDATION (Level 4)
   - The rule they can articulate
   - The prediction they can now make

6. TRANSFER (Level 5)
   - New scenario with same principle
   - How they apply it differently

/*
 * ENHANCEMENT PLAN - [GAME NAME]
 * Phase 3 Complete: Learning Architecture
 *
 * [Keep Phase 1-2 content]
 *
 * LEARNING ARCS:
 *
 * Concept 1: [Name]
 * - Misconception: [What they start believing]
 * - Aha moment: [The revelation that changes their mind]
 * - Exit state: [What they can now do]
 *
 * [Repeat for all 10 - keep each to 3 lines]
 *
 * KEY CROSS-CONCEPT CONNECTIONS:
 * - [Concept X] reinforces [Concept Y] because...
 * - [Concept Z] must come before [Concept W] because...
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 4
