PHASE 1 OF 3: RESEARCH & DESIGN
=================================

You are enhancing an existing educational game renderer. This phase focuses on RESEARCH and DESIGN PLANNING only.
DO NOT write any code in this phase. Instead, analyze the existing game and create a detailed improvement plan.

OBJECTIVE: Analyze the current game implementation and design improvements based on expert knowledge extraction, understanding architecture, and real-world scenario design.

STEP 1: ANALYZE EXISTING GAME
-----------------------------
Read the current renderer code and document:
- What concepts does it currently teach?
- What interactive elements exist?
- What feedback mechanisms are in place?
- What are the current strengths and weaknesses?

STEP 2: EXPERT KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION (10 Core Concepts)
------------------------------------------------------
For this specific topic, identify the 10 most important concepts that:
- A professional would use at least weekly
- Explain WHY something happens, not just WHAT
- Are decision-relevant and future-proof (still matter in 2040)
- Would separate a novice from a 10-year veteran

For each concept, briefly note:
- The core insight (what experts know that beginners don't)
- The common misconception
- The causal chain (why it works this way)

STEP 3: UNDERSTANDING ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------------
For each concept, define the learning journey:
- Level 0: The misconception users start with
- Level 5: The mastery state (can predict and apply)
- The "aha moment" that bridges them

STEP 4: SCENARIO DESIGN
-----------------------
Design 3-5 authentic real-world scenarios where users will learn these concepts:
- Real stakes and consequences
- Authentic numbers (research actual values)
- Professional recognition ("yes, this is exactly what it's like")

OUTPUT FORMAT:
--------------
After your analysis, add a comment block at the TOP of the renderer function with your research notes in this format:

/*
 * ENHANCEMENT PLAN - [GAME NAME]
 * Phase 1 Complete: Research & Design
 *
 * CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:
 * - [What the game currently does]
 * - [Strengths]
 * - [Gaps to address]
 *
 * 10 CORE CONCEPTS:
 * 1. [Concept] - [Core insight] - [Misconception to address]
 * 2. [Concept] - [Core insight] - [Misconception to address]
 * ... (list all 10)
 *
 * LEARNING ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Concept sequence: [1] -> [2] -> ... -> [10]
 * - Key "aha moments": [list 3-5]
 *
 * SCENARIOS:
 * 1. [Scenario name]: [Brief description]
 * 2. [Scenario name]: [Brief description]
 * ... (3-5 scenarios)
 *
 * READY FOR PHASE 2: Implementation
 */

IMPORTANT:
- Keep the comment block concise (under 100 lines)
- Focus on actionable insights, not lengthy descriptions
- The existing game code should remain UNCHANGED except for adding this comment block
- This comment will guide Phase 2 implementation
