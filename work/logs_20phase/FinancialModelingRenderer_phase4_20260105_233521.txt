The changes have been successfully applied. The ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block now includes:
- Phase 4 Complete in the header (line 62195)
- OPTIMAL SEQUENCE section (lines 62338-62348)
- INTEGRATION CHECKPOINTS section (lines 62350-62354)
- GAME FLOW section (lines 62356-62360)
- "READY FOR PHASE 5" marker (line 62362)

The file structure is correct and the Phase 4 content follows the required format. The comment block properly closes and the FinancialModelingRenderer function begins correctly after it.
