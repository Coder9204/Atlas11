The Phase 10 documentation has been successfully updated with the proper format including:
- BACKGROUNDS table with 11 assets
- INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS table with 10 assets 
- VISUALIZATIONS table with 10 assets
- ICONS table with 16 items
- STATE INDICATORS table
- ANIMATION ASSETS table
- ACCESSIBILITY section
- CARRY FORWARD section with counts and phase references

Since the build commands require approval in batch mode and I cannot execute them, I have verified that:
1. The edit was successfully applied to the file
2. The Phase 10 documentation follows the required format
3. The change only affects the comment block within the ZeroBasedBudgetRenderer function

The edit only modified comments (no actual code changes), so there's no risk of compilation errors from this change.

DONE ZeroBasedBudgetRenderer PHASE 10
