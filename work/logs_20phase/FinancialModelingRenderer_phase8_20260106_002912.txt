The Phase 8 screen specifications have been successfully added to the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block. The edit:

1. Added detailed SCREEN SPECIFICATIONS section for all 10 concepts
2. Each concept has 6-8 screens with proper S1-S8 notation
3. Each screen specifies: Hook, Goal, Teach (with Action + Learn), Practice, Predict, Transfer, Takeaway
4. Included 3 integration checkpoints and final integration challenge
5. Added "PLANNING PHASES COMPLETE - READY FOR BUILDING (Phase 9)" marker

Since this was a comment-only change (no TypeScript code modified), the type check would pass. The structure follows the Phase 8 specification format exactly.
