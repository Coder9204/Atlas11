I'm unable to run the TypeScript check due to approval requirements in the batch environment. However, the changes I made are:

1. Only modified a comment block (no code changes)
2. The comment block structure is valid - starts with `/*` at line 62190, ends with `*/` at line 62443
3. The function declaration `const FinancialModelingRenderer = () => {` follows immediately after
4. Added 12 detailed scenarios covering all 10 core concepts plus 2 integration scenarios
5. Included SCENARIO VARIETY CHECK with industries, scales, time horizons, and stakeholders

Since Phase 5 is purely documentation/planning (updating the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block), there should be no TypeScript errors - the change only modifies comments, not executable code.

DONE FinancialModelingRenderer PHASE 5
