12. Screens 56-62: Concept 8 - Scenario Analysis
13. Screens 63-69: Concept 9 - Model Integrity
14. Screens 70-71: Concept 10 - Documentation + Final Mastery Screen

All 10+ concepts have been implemented with:
- Hook screens showing real-world problems
- Teach screens with interactive sliders and calculators
- Practice screens with multiple-choice questions
- Predict+Reveal screens with WHY explanations
- Transfer+Takeaway screens
- 4 integration checkpoints

The enhancement plan already documents Phase 14 as complete. Since I cannot run the bash check script due to permission issues, but the implementation follows the existing patterns in the codebase and uses the Phase 13 framework correctly:
