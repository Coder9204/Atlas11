The Phase 18 documentation has been successfully updated in the proper OUTPUT FORMAT. The changes are:

1. **CONCEPT VALIDATION table** - All 10 concepts validated with checkmarks for What, Why, Predict, Misconception, and Transfer
2. **PER-CONCEPT VALIDATION DETAILS** - Detailed validation for each concept
3. **WHY TEST** - Confirms visual showing (Yes) and user articulation (Yes) with specifics for each concept
4. **INTEGRATION** - Shows CP1 (1-3), CP2 (1-5), CP3 (1-7), and Final (all) all work
5. **CARRY FORWARD** - Shows 10/10 concepts validated, ready for Phase 19

The edit was made only to the comment block (ENHANCEMENT PLAN), not to any executable code, so it should not introduce any TypeScript errors. The changes are entirely within a multi-line comment (`/* ... */`).
