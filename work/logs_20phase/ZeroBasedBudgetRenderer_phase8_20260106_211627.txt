   - 3 Integration Checkpoints + 1 Takeaway Screen = 76 total screens

3. **Screen Layout Standard** with height/content specifications
4. **Total Screens**: 76 (72 concept screens + 3 integration + 1 takeaway)
5. **Estimated Play Time**: 35-45 minutes
6. **"READY FOR BUILDING (Phase 9)"** marker at line 58261

All screens have Q1 (Action), Q2 (Goal), navigation specs, and most have Q3 (Before→After) and Q4 (WHY shown). The coverage exceeds the 60% minimum requirement for core specs.

I was unable to run the validation script due to approval requirements, but the Phase 8 content is already complete and properly formatted in the file.
