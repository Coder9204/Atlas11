The changes are all contained within a valid multi-line comment block (`/*` at line 57569 and `*/` at line 57781). The comment block properly closes before the `const ZeroBasedBudgetRenderer` function definition. The Phase 4 changes are purely documentation updates as expected.

DONE ZeroBasedBudgetRenderer PHASE 4
