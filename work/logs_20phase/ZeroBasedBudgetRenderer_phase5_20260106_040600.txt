I've successfully updated the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block with the Phase 5 Scenario Design content. The scenarios I added include:

- 12 detailed real-world scenarios for each of the 10 ZBB concepts plus 2 integration scenarios
- Each scenario follows the required format with Role, Decision, Stakes, and Mechanism revealed
- Industries covered: Healthcare, Manufacturing, SaaS, Nonprofit, Higher Education, Consumer Electronics, Arts, Banking, E-commerce, Hospitality, Professional Services  
- Scales: Individual department ($45K-$400K), Division ($1M-$2M), Organization-wide ($18M-$50M)
- Time horizons: Immediate, Short-term, Long-term
- Scenario variety check included

Unfortunately I was unable to run the TypeScript check (`npx tsc --noEmit`) due to command approval requirements in this batch mode session. However, since Phase 5 only modifies the comment block (ENHANCEMENT PLAN) and does not change any actual code, there should be no TypeScript errors introduced.
