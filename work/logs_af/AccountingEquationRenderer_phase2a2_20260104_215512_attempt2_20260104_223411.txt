Everything looks correct. The implementation includes:

1. **Concept 1: Dual Effect Principle** (Screens 0-2)
   - Screen 0: Intro - explains that every transaction affects 2+ accounts
   - Screen 1: Prediction - asks user to predict how many accounts change when buying equipment
   - Screen 2: Reveal - shows the actual effect and explains WHY the equation balances

2. **Concept 2: Asset-for-Asset Exchange** (Screens 3-5)
   - Screen 3: Intro - explains that swapping assets doesn't change total assets
   - Screen 4: Prediction - bakery scenario asking about total assets after buying an oven
   - Screen 5: Reveal - shows before/after with visual comparison

3. **Concept 3: Debt Funding Creates Parallel Increase** (Screens 6-8)
   - Screen 6: Intro - explains that loans increase both sides equally
   - Screen 7: Prediction - startup scenario asking about equity after taking a loan
   - Screen 8: Reveal - shows the equation before/after with detailed explanation

The implementation:
- Uses the prediction infrastructure from Phase 2a1 (handlePrediction, nextScreen, prediction state)
- Each concept has 3 screens (intro, prediction, reveal)
- Follows the pattern specified in Phase 2a2 instructions
- Updates the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment to show completion
