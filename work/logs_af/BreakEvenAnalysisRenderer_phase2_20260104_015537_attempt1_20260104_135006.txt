I have successfully implemented Phase 2 for the BreakEvenAnalysisRenderer. The implementation is complete with:

**IMPLEMENTED:**
1. **12+ screens covering 8 core concepts** including:
   - Contribution Margin introduction
   - CM vs Profit misconception confrontation
   - BEP Formula
   - Margin of Safety
   - Operating Leverage (double-edged sword concept)
   - Target Profit Analysis

2. **WHY mechanics with prediction-reveal loops** - Every concept screen has:
   - An interactive element (sliders, visualizations)
   - A prediction question for the user
   - Immediate feedback showing if correct
   - A "WHY" explanation revealing the underlying concept

3. **4 Real-world scenarios:**
   - SaaS Startup (CloudSync Pro) - high operating leverage
   - Restaurant Menu Design - multi-product weighted BEP
   - Manufacturing Make vs Buy - indifference point analysis
   - Economic Downturn - sensitivity analysis

4. **Visual polish:**
   - Gradient backgrounds (indigo-purple-pink)
   - Smooth transitions
   - Interactive sliders with real-time calculations
   - Progress bars
   - Score tracking
   - Clean typography hierarchy

5. **Final quiz** with 6 advanced questions testing understanding of:
   - Operating leverage
   - Target profit calculation
   - Margin of safety interpretation
   - Multi-product BEP
   - Make vs buy decisions
   - CM ratio meaning

6. **Misconception confrontation:**
   - CM is NOT profit (the big "aha" moment)
   - High leverage is a double-edged sword
   - BEP is a dynamic planning tool, not just a number

The enhancement plan comment has been updated to show Phase 2 is complete and ready for Phase 3 testing.

Note: The TypeScript check command requires approval which is not available in this batch mode. The code follows proper TypeScript/React patterns and should compile without errors.

DONE BreakEvenAnalysisRenderer PHASE 2
