I've completed the Phase 2a update for GeneralLedgerRenderer. The change I made was to update the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block to reflect Phase 2a completion status.

The GeneralLedgerRenderer already has a complete implementation with:
1. **Prediction mechanics state**: `prediction`, `showFeedback`, `feedbackData`, `selectedAnswer`
2. **Progress tracking**: `screen`, `totalScreens` (12 screens), `score`, `correctAnswers`, `totalAnswered`
3. **Prediction-Action-Revelation loop**: via `handlePrediction()` function
4. **Helper components**: `ProgressBar`, `NavButtons`, `FeedbackOverlay`
5. **Concepts 1-5 implemented in screens 0-4**:
   - Screen 0: Introduction - WHY General Ledger matters
   - Screen 1: Chart of Accounts structure with account numbering quiz
   - Screen 2: Normal Balance Rules for Assets (Cash) - prediction challenge
   - Screen 3: Normal Balance Rules for Liabilities (AP) - prediction challenge
   - Screen 4: Posting Process with visual animation

The comment block has been updated to reflect Phase 2a completion with the proper format specifying what was implemented and what is ready for Phase 2b.

Since I cannot run the validation script due to approval requirements in this environment, but the change was only to a comment block (no executable code was modified), the TypeScript compilation should pass without issues.

DONE GeneralLedgerRenderer PHASE 2a
