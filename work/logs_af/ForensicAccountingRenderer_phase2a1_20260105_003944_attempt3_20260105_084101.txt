The Phase 2a1 infrastructure has been successfully added to ForensicAccountingRenderer:

1. **Updated ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment** (lines 62246-62263):
   - Marked Phase 2a1 Complete: Infrastructure
   - Listed all completed items with checkmarks

2. **Added enhanced screen navigation** (lines 62293-62295):
   - `currentScreenEnhanced` state variable
   - `totalScreensEnhanced = 13` (10 concepts + 2 scenarios + 1 summary)

3. **Added enhanced prediction mechanics** (lines 62297-62299):
   - `showPredictionResultEnhanced` state
   - `predictionCorrectEnhanced` state

4. **Added enhanced tracking** (lines 62301-62304):
   - `conceptsLearned` array state
   - `totalPredictionsEnhanced` counter
   - `correctPredictionsEnhanced` counter

5. **Added helper functions** (lines 62306-62330):
   - `handlePredictionEnhanced(prediction, correctAnswer, conceptName)` - handles prediction flow
   - `nextScreenEnhanced()` - navigate to next screen
   - `prevScreenEnhanced()` - navigate to previous screen

The existing game logic (totalScreens=12, nextScreen, resetScreen, recordAnswer) has been preserved to avoid breaking the current implementation.

Since I cannot run the validation checks in unattended mode (bash commands require approval), I've verified the code structure by reading the file. The TypeScript code appears syntactically correct with proper:
- useState hook declarations with proper types
- Function definitions with appropriate parameters
- Consistent naming patterns using "Enhanced" suffix to avoid conflicts

DONE ForensicAccountingRenderer PHASE 2a1
