The comment block has been properly added. The enhancement plan is correctly placed at the top of the AuditPrepRenderer function (line 60020-60079), with the function declaration properly following it (line 60080). The comment is valid JavaScript/TypeScript multi-line comment syntax.

Since I cannot run the validation scripts due to command approval restrictions, but the change I made was only adding a comment block (no logic changes), the file should remain syntactically valid. The comment block:
- Opens with `/*` at line 60020
- Closes with `*/` at line 60079
- Is followed by the unchanged function declaration at line 60080

DONE AuditPrepRenderer PHASE 1
