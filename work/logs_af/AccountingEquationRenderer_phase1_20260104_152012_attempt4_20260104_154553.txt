The edit was successful. The enhancement plan comment block has been properly added inside the AccountingEquationRenderer function, right after the function declaration and before any code. The comment block:

1. Is properly formatted as a multi-line comment (`/* ... */`)
2. Includes the Phase 1 Complete marker
3. Documents the current state analysis with strengths and gaps
4. Lists all 10 core concepts with their insights and misconceptions
5. Defines the learning architecture with sequencing and "aha moments"
6. Describes 5 real-world scenarios with authentic details
7. Outlines the prediction mechanics to be added in Phase 2
8. Ends with "READY FOR PHASE 2: Implementation"

The existing game code remains unchanged (only the comment was added at the top of the function body).
