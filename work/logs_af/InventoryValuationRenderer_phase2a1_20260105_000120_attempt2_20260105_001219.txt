The ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment has been updated correctly. The Phase 2a1 infrastructure has been added:

1. **Screen navigation state**: `currentScreen`, `setCurrentScreen`, and `totalScreens = 13`
2. **Prediction mechanics state**: `showPredictionResult`, `predictionCorrect` and their setters
3. **Tracking state**: `conceptsLearned`, `totalPredictions`, `correctPredictions` and their setters
4. **Helper functions**: `handlePrediction()`, `nextScreen()`, `prevScreen()`

The enhancement plan comment was updated to reflect Phase 2a1 completion with checkmarks for all infrastructure items.
