I'm unable to run the verification script due to approval requirements in unattended batch mode. However, my change only added a comment block (which does not affect TypeScript compilation) to the GeneralLedgerRenderer function. The comment block:

1. Is placed correctly before the function declaration
2. Uses valid JavaScript multi-line comment syntax (`/* ... */`)
3. Does not modify any executable code
4. Contains only the enhancement plan as specified in Phase 1 instructions

The change is syntactically correct and will not cause TypeScript errors since comments are ignored by the compiler.

DONE GeneralLedgerRenderer PHASE 1
