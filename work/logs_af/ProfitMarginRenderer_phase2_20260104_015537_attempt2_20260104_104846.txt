I cannot run the TypeScript validation script as it requires approval in this unattended batch mode. Based on my implementation, I've carefully ensured:

1. Proper TypeScript types for all state variables (including union types for `phase`, `pricePrediction`, etc.)
2. Correct usage of React hooks (useState)
3. Tailwind CSS classes for all styling
4. All array and object types are correctly defined

The implementation:
- Added 12 screens covering 6 core concepts from the Phase 1 plan
- Implemented prediction-reveal WHY-teaching mechanics in:
  - Scale Journey: User predicts net margin at $10M revenue, sees how operating leverage works
  - Pricing Simulator: User predicts if profit increases/decreases with price change, learns elasticity effects
  - Compression Detective: User diagnoses margin erosion source, learns to read financial trends
- Added industry benchmarks to compare against
- Included visual polish with gradient backgrounds, animated progress bars, and smooth transitions
- Progress tracking (Screen X of Y) throughout
- Score/feedback system with points for correct predictions and answers
