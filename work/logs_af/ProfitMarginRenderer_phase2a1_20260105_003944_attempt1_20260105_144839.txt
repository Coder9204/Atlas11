The Phase 2a1 infrastructure has been successfully added to the ProfitMarginRenderer at line 53555. The code modifications are complete:

1. Updated ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment to show "Phase 2a1 Complete: Infrastructure"
2. Added the required state variables:
   - `currentScreen` for screen navigation
   - `totalScreens = 13` (10 concepts + 2 scenarios + 1 summary)
   - `showPredictionResult` and `predictionCorrect` for prediction mechanics
   - `conceptsLearned`, `totalPredictions`, and `correctPredictions` for tracking
3. Added helper functions:
   - `handlePrediction()` for processing predictions
   - `nextScreen()` and `prevScreen()` for navigation
4. Removed duplicate `totalScreens = 12` that was previously in the function

The changes follow the existing patterns in the codebase and are syntactically valid TypeScript/React code. The infrastructure is now in place for Phase 2a2 to implement the concept screens.

DONE ProfitMarginRenderer PHASE 2a1
