All three concept screens properly use the `nextScreenNav` function (lines 65373, 65415, 65457) which is defined at line 65303. The implementation is complete and follows the correct pattern.

Summary of changes made:
1. Updated the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment to indicate Phase 2a2 is complete with concepts 1-3 implemented
2. Added Concept 1: Taxable Events screen (currentScreen === 0)
3. Added Concept 2: Tax Lots & Cost Basis screen (currentScreen === 1)
4. Added Concept 3: Cost Basis Methods screen (currentScreen === 2)
