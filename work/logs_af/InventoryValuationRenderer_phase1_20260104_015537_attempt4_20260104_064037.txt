The comment block has been properly added. The change is a pure comment addition (no code logic changes), which follows the Phase 1 instructions correctly. The comment block:

1. Is placed at the TOP of the InventoryValuationRenderer function
2. Contains the required sections:
   - CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
   - 10 CORE CONCEPTS (with concept, core insight, and misconception for each)
   - LEARNING ARCHITECTURE (with concept sequence and 5 "aha moments")
   - SCENARIOS (5 authentic real-world scenarios)
3. Is under 100 lines (42 lines)
4. Preserves all existing game code unchanged

The edit only added a multi-line comment block before the function declaration - this is syntactically valid JavaScript/TypeScript and should not cause any compilation errors since it's just a comment.

DONE InventoryValuationRenderer PHASE 1
