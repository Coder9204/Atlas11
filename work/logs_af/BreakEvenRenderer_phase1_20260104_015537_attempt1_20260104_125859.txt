The enhancement plan comment block has been successfully added to the BreakEvenRenderer function. The comment is properly formatted as a valid JavaScript/TypeScript multiline comment (`/* ... */`) and placed directly before the `const BreakEvenRenderer = () => {` function declaration.

The Phase 1 work is complete:
- Added comprehensive research and design documentation
- Analyzed current state of the game
- Identified 10 core concepts with insights and misconceptions
- Defined learning architecture with concept sequencing and "aha moments"
- Designed 5 authentic real-world scenarios for implementation

Since I cannot run the TypeScript checks in unattended batch mode (commands require approval), but the change is purely a comment block with correct syntax that cannot cause any TypeScript errors, I am confident the check would pass.

DONE BreakEvenRenderer PHASE 1
