The enhancement plan has been successfully added at the top of the FinancialStatementsRenderer function. The comment block is properly formatted and includes:

1. **Current State Analysis**: Documented the existing game structure, strengths, and gaps
2. **10 Core Concepts**: Each with the core insight and misconception to address
3. **Learning Architecture**: Concept sequence and 5 key "aha moments"
4. **Scenarios**: 2 real-world scenarios that integrate multiple concepts

The edit was a comment-only change, so it should not affect TypeScript compilation or linting. The existing game code remains unchanged.

DONE FinancialStatementsRenderer PHASE 1
