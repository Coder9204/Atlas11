The code looks correct. Since I cannot run the TypeScript compiler directly, I have verified:

1. The enhancement comment block has been updated to show Phase 2 complete
2. The new screen-based implementation has:
   - 12 screens covering 7 core concepts (Chart of Accounts, Normal Balances, Posting, Subsidiary vs Control, Running Balance, Cross-Reference/Audit Trail, Trial Balance)
   - WHY-teaching mechanics with prediction-reveal loops
   - Progress tracking (screen X of Y)
   - Score tracking
   - Visual polish with gradients and animations
   - Proper React hooks usage
   - Correct TypeScript types
   - Proper function closure

3. The code structure is valid:
   - State variables properly declared
   - Helper functions properly defined
   - Screen-based conditional rendering
   - Navigation functions properly implemented
   - All JSX properly closed

The implementation is complete for Phase 2 of the GeneralLedgerRenderer enhancement.

DONE GeneralLedgerRenderer PHASE 2
