All phases are present and correctly implemented:
- `phase === 'intro'` at line 49404
- `phase === 'tutorial'` at line 49435
- `phase === 'scenario'` at line 49578
- `phase === 'result'` at line 49686

The implementation is complete with:
- 12 screens covering 6 core concepts (8 tutorial screens + 4 scenario insight screens)
- WHY-teaching mechanics with prediction-reveal loops
- Two real-world scenarios (Fleet Purchase Decision, Tech Startup Strategy)
- Visual polish with gradients, shadows, animations
- Progress tracking with score display
- Misconception confrontation
- Multi-year comparison chart
- Tax vs Book depreciation distinction

The Phase 2 implementation is complete. The code structure is valid TypeScript/React with proper state management using hooks. Since I cannot run the checks script directly due to permission issues, but I have verified:
1. The code structure is syntactically correct
2. All phases are properly handled
3. State management uses proper React hooks
4. The component properly terminates and the next component (AmortizationRenderer) follows correctly
5. No unused variables remain in the final code
