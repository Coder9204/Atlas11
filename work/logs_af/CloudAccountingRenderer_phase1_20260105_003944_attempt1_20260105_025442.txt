The enhancement plan comment block has been successfully added at the top of the CloudAccountingRenderer function. The comment block includes:

1. **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS** - Identified the existing game structure (7 tutorial steps, 4 scenarios, 5 quiz questions) and its strengths/gaps

2. **10 CORE CONCEPTS** with expert insights and misconceptions:
   - Total Cost of Ownership (hidden costs)
   - Bank Feed Reconciliation (automatic ≠ accurate)
   - Integration Data Flow (single source of truth)
   - Chart of Accounts Design (planning upfront)
   - Multi-Entity Consolidation (intercompany complexity)
   - User Permissions & SOD (fraud prevention)
   - API Rate Limits (data gaps)
   - Data Ownership & Portability (vendor lock-in)
   - Automation Rules Lifecycle (maintenance needs)
   - Disaster Recovery & Backups (cloud vulnerabilities)

3. **LEARNING ARCHITECTURE** - Logical sequence and 5 key "aha moments"

4. **SCENARIOS** - 5 realistic real-world scenarios with actual stakes

The existing game code remains unchanged - only the comment block was added.
