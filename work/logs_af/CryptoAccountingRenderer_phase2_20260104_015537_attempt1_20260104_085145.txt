The implementation is complete and properly structured. The CryptoAccountingRenderer function is complete and properly closed, and transitions correctly to TaxCreditsRenderer. The implementation includes:

1. **12 interactive screens** covering 7 core concepts
2. **WHY-teaching mechanics** with prediction-reveal loops
3. **Misconception confrontation** on intro screen and throughout
4. **Real-world scenarios**: Tax Loss Harvesting, Airdrop Tax Trap, DeFi Staking, Cross-Chain Complexity
5. **Visual polish**: gradients, animations, progress tracking, feedback states
6. **Score/feedback system** with grade calculation

The code structure is valid React/TypeScript with proper:
- State management with useState hooks
- Screen-based navigation
- Conditional rendering
- Event handlers
- Tailwind CSS styling

DONE CryptoAccountingRenderer PHASE 2
