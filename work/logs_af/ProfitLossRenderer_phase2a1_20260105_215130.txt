The code looks correct syntactically. The Phase 2a1 infrastructure has been added successfully to the ProfitLossRenderer function:

1. **Screen navigation state**: `currentScreen` and `totalScreens = 13`
2. **Prediction mechanics**: `showPredictionResult` and `predictionCorrect` states
3. **Tracking states**: `conceptsLearned`, `totalPredictions`, and `correctPredictions`
4. **Helper functions**: `handlePrediction`, `nextScreen`, and `prevScreen`
5. **Updated comment block**: Phase 2a1 Complete checklist added

The implementation follows the same pattern as the BreakEvenRenderer (which already has Phase 2a1 complete) and matches the required infrastructure specified in the instructions.

DONE ProfitLossRenderer PHASE 2a1
