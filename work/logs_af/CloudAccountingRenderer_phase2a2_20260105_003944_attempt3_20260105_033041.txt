All the code is correctly implemented. The implementation:

1. **Updated the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment** to show Phase 2a2 is complete with:
   - [X] Concept 1: Chart of Accounts Design - 1 screen
   - [X] Concept 2: Total Cost of Ownership - 1 screen
   - [X] Concept 3: Bank Feed Reconciliation - 1 screen

2. **Added 'concepts' phase type** to the state declaration

3. **Updated intro phase button** to navigate to 'concepts' phase instead of 'tutorial'

4. **Added concepts phase with 3 screens**:
   - Screen 0: Chart of Accounts Design - prediction about using default templates
   - Screen 1: Total Cost of Ownership - prediction about true monthly cost
   - Screen 2: Bank Feed Reconciliation - prediction about auto-matching problems

5. **Each screen follows the combined pattern**:
   - Shows concept number (1 OF 10, etc.)
   - Has scenario description
   - Has prediction options (click to reveal)
   - Shows WHY explanation after prediction
   - Has Next Concept button (or Continue to Tutorial for last)

6. **Updated the reset function** in the result phase to include all new state variables
