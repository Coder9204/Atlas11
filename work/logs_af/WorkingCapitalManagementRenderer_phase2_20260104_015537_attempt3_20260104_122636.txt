The implementation is complete. Let me summarize what was implemented in Phase 2:

**Phase 2 Implementation Summary for WorkingCapitalManagementRenderer:**

1. **WHY-Teaching Mechanics Implemented:**
   - Prediction-Reveal loops: Users predict CCC calculation and APR costs before seeing answers
   - Misconception confrontation: "2% discount = 36% APR" revelation challenges intuition
   - Immediate feedback with score tracking

2. **Learning Screens (7 core concept screens):**
   - CCC Introduction with animated cash flow timeline
   - CCC Prediction Quiz (predict before reveal)
   - 2/10 net 30 Discount Analysis (36% APR revelation)
   - Growth Capital Calculator (interactive slider shows working capital needs)
   - Amazon Negative CCC Case Study with trade-off analysis
   - Industry Benchmarking visualization
   - Inventory Carrying Cost breakdown (25% annual true cost)

3. **Challenge Scenarios (4 interactive optimizations):**
   - Retail Optimizer (MidTown Goods)
   - B2B Challenge (IndustrialParts)
   - Negative CCC Quest (CloudSaaS)
   - Holiday Rush (Seasonal ToyStore)

4. **Visual Polish:**
   - Gradient backgrounds and cards
   - Progress tracking with animated bars
   - Score system throughout
   - Smooth transitions between screens
   - Clean typography hierarchy
   - Interactive sliders with constraints

5. **Game Flow:**
   - Intro -> Learn (7 screens) -> Challenge (4 scenarios) -> Result
   - Each screen has one learning goal
   - Progress indicators show "Screen X of Y"

The implementation cannot be verified with TypeScript compilation in unattended mode due to command approval requirements. The code follows proper React patterns and TypeScript conventions.
