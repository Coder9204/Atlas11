The enhancement plan comment block has been successfully added at the top of the `WorkingCapitalManagementRenderer` function. The comment block follows correct JavaScript/TypeScript multiline comment syntax (`/* ... */`) and will not affect the code's functionality.

The change made was adding a Phase 1 Enhancement Plan comment block (41 lines, well under the 100-line limit) that includes:
- Current state analysis of the game
- 10 core concepts with expert insights and misconceptions to address
- Learning architecture with concept sequencing and key "aha moments"
- 5 real-world scenario designs for implementation

Since I'm in unattended batch mode and unable to run the TypeScript checks due to command approval requirements, but the change was only a comment block (no code logic modifications), it should pass TypeScript checks without issues.

DONE WorkingCapitalManagementRenderer PHASE 1
