I've successfully implemented Phase 2a for the DepreciationMethodsRenderer. Let me verify my implementation is complete by reviewing what was added:

1. **Updated ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment** - Updated to show Phase 2a Complete with checklist of implemented features

2. **Added prediction mechanics state variables:**
   - `predictionMode`
   - `userPrediction` 
   - `showPredictionResult`
   - `cashFlowPrediction`, `methodComparisonYear`, `selectedTaxBook`, `halfYearPrediction`, `salvagePrediction` for concept-specific predictions

3. **Implemented Concepts 1-5 with screens:**
   - **Concept 1 (Matching Principle):** Screen 0 - Prediction about cash flow impact of depreciation
   - **Concept 2 (Method Selection Impact):** Screens 1-2 - Prediction about profit differences + interactive year slider
   - **Concept 3 (Tax vs Book):** Screens 3-4 - Prediction about legality + visualization of dual reporting
   - **Concept 4 (Half-Year Convention):** Screens 5-6 - Prediction about Year 1 depreciation + 6-year visualization
   - **Concept 5 (Salvage Value):** Screens 7-8 - Prediction about total depreciation + strategic implications

4. **Added progress tracking:**
   - `totalScreens = 15`
   - `getCurrentScreenNumber()` function
   - `ProgressBar` component showing screen X of Y with visual progress bar

5. **Maintained original practice functionality** - The calculation game with 3 assets is preserved

6. **Enhanced results screen** - Shows 5 key insights learned from the concepts

The implementation follows the Prediction-Action-Revelation loop pattern for each concept where users first predict, then see the reveal with WHY explanations.

DONE DepreciationMethodsRenderer PHASE 2a
