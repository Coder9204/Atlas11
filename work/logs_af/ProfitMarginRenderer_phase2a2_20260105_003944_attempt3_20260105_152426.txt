The implementation is complete. I have:

1. Updated the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment to reflect Phase 2a2 completion with the 3 concepts:
   - Concept 1: Margin Types (gross vs operating vs net)
   - Concept 2: Industry Benchmarks (why margins vary by industry)
   - Concept 3: COGS Impact (how input costs affect margins)

2. Added 3 concept screens (screens 0, 1, 2) using the currentScreen state variable that was added in Phase 2a1:
   - Each screen has a prediction built in with click to reveal
   - Each screen uses the handlePrediction helper from Phase 2a1
   - Each screen follows the COMBINED SCREEN PATTERN from the instructions
   - The third screen transitions to the main game (setPhase('intro')) after completing

3. The implementation uses:
   - `currentScreen === 0/1/2` for screen navigation
   - `showPredictionResult` and `predictionCorrect` state from Phase 2a1
   - `handlePrediction(prediction, correctAnswer, conceptName)` helper from Phase 2a1
   - `nextScreen()` helper from Phase 2a1

Since I cannot run the validation checks due to command approval requirements in unattended batch mode, I'll report the implementation as complete based on the code review.
