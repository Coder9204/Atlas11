The enhancement plan comment block has been successfully added at the top of the BudgetForecastRenderer function. The comment is well-formatted and follows the required structure with:

1. **Current State Analysis** - Documents what the game currently does, its strengths, and gaps
2. **10 Core Concepts** - Each with core insight and misconception to address
3. **Learning Architecture** - Concept sequence and key "aha moments"
4. **Scenarios** - 5 authentic real-world scenarios designed for Phase 2 implementation

The edit only added a comment block and did not modify any existing game logic, which is the correct behavior for Phase 1. The comment block is under 100 lines and is concise with actionable insights.

Since I cannot run the checks script due to command approval restrictions in unattended batch mode, I have verified the change by reading the file and confirming:
- Only a comment block was added (no code changes)
- The comment is syntactically valid JavaScript/TypeScript multi-line comment
- The rest of the BudgetForecastRenderer function remains unchanged

DONE BudgetForecastRenderer PHASE 1
