The implementation is complete. Let me do a final verification to ensure everything follows the pattern correctly by checking that the screens flow properly:

1. Screen 0-4: Concepts 1-5 (Chart of Accounts Design, TCO, Bank Feed, Automation Rules, Integration Data Flow)
2. Screen 5: Concept 6 - User Permissions & SOD ✓
3. Screen 6: Concept 7 - API Rate Limits ✓ 
4. Screen 7: Concept 8 - Data Ownership & Portability ✓ (transitions to tutorial phase)

The implementation:
- Uses the combined screen pattern with prediction built-in (click to reveal)
- Each screen has proper concept numbering (CONCEPT 6 OF 10, CONCEPT 7 OF 10, CONCEPT 8 OF 10)
- Uses the handleConceptPrediction helper function
- Uses nextConceptScreen for navigation
- Shows WHY explanations after prediction
- Screen 7 transitions to tutorial phase after completion (like the original screen 4 did)

The ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment has been updated to show Phase 2b1 Complete with all 3 concepts checked off.
