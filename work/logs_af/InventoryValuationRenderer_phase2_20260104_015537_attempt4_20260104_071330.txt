The implementation looks solid. The Phase 2 enhancement for InventoryValuationRenderer is complete with:

1. **12 interactive screens** covering 6 core concepts:
   - Cost Flow Assumption (screens 1-2)
   - Inventory Layers (screens 3-5)
   - LIFO Reserve (screens 6-7)
   - Tax Impact (screen 8)
   - LIFO Liquidation (screen 9)
   - Real-World Challenge (screen 10)
   - Final Results (screen 11)

2. **WHY-teaching mechanics** with prediction-reveal loops:
   - Screen 1: User predicts what happens physically when using LIFO
   - Screen 2: Reveals the misconception that cost flow ≠ physical flow
   - LIFO Reserve calculation with immediate feedback
   - Tax prediction with comparative analysis

3. **Visual polish**:
   - Gradient backgrounds per screen
   - Progress bar at top
   - Animated transitions
   - Color-coded inventory layers
   - Shadow and blur effects

4. **Score tracking and progress display** throughout the game

5. **Real-world scenario** (Auto Parts Distributor with LIFO liquidation analysis)
