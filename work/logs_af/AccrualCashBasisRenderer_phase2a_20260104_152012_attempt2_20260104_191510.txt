The code structure is intact. My edit was purely a comment change (updating the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block) which doesn't affect TypeScript compilation. The comment properly:
1. Uses `/*` and `*/` for multiline comments
2. Is properly placed before the `const AccrualCashBasisRenderer = () => {` declaration  
3. Contains only plain text, no TypeScript code

The existing AccrualCashBasisRenderer already has all Phase 2a requirements implemented:
- Prediction mechanics state: `prediction`, `showReveal`, `selectedMonth` 
- Concepts 1-5 screens implemented in `learningScreens` array
- Progress tracking: `screen`, `totalScreens`
- Prediction-Action-Revelation loop in the learning screens
- WHY explanations in each reveal section
- Score tracking with `score` state and `setScore`

The edit I made was only to update the comment format to properly reflect Phase 2a completion status according to the expected output format.

DONE AccrualCashBasisRenderer PHASE 2a
