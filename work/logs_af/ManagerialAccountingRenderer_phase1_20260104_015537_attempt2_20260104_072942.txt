The comment block has been successfully added and is properly formatted. The enhancement plan is complete:

1. **Comment block added** at the top of ManagerialAccountingRenderer (lines 58003-58041)
2. **Structure is valid** - proper multi-line comment syntax (`/*` ... `*/`)
3. **Content follows Phase 1 requirements**:
   - Current state analysis documenting what the game currently does
   - 10 core concepts with insights and misconceptions
   - Learning architecture with concept sequence and "aha moments"
   - 5 practical scenarios for Phase 2 implementation

The comment is a pure comment block that does not affect any JavaScript/TypeScript code execution, so it cannot introduce type errors or break the build.

DONE ManagerialAccountingRenderer PHASE 1
