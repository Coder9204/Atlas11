The CryptoAccountingRenderer component properly ends with `return null;` and `};` before TaxCreditsRenderer starts. The code structure is correct.

Let me summarize what was done in Phase 2b2:

**Phase 2b2 Complete for CryptoAccountingRenderer:**

1. **Concept 9: Tax Loss Harvesting** (currentScreen === 8)
   - Interactive scenario about year-end tax loss harvesting strategy
   - Teaches the benefits of realizing losses to offset capital gains

2. **Concept 10: FASB Fair Value Accounting** (currentScreen === 9)
   - Explains the new FASB ASU 2023-08 rules for crypto accounting
   - Shows how public companies must mark-to-market their crypto holdings

3. **Scenario Challenge 1: DeFi Yield Farm Tax Trap** (currentScreen === 10)
   - Real-world scenario combining staking income, token depreciation, and hack losses
   - Demonstrates the complexity of DeFi taxation

4. **Scenario Challenge 2: NFT Creator Tax Optimization** (currentScreen === 11)
   - Real-world scenario for NFT artists covering self-employment income, gas deductions, and royalties
   - Combines multiple concepts into a practical example

5. **Summary Screen** (currentScreen === 12)
   - Shows mastery percentage and concepts learned
   - Provides key takeaways
   - Has a "Practice Again" button to restart

The enhancement plan comment has been updated to reflect Phase 2b2 completion with all the new screens documented.
