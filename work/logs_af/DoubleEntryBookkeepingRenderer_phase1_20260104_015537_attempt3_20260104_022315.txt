I've added the Phase 1 enhancement plan comment block to the DoubleEntryBookkeepingRenderer function. The edit successfully added a comprehensive research and design comment block that includes:

1. **Current State Analysis**: Documents the existing functionality (drag-drop T-accounts, 5 levels, 15 scenarios) and identifies gaps (no compound entries, no journal-to-ledger flow, etc.)

2. **10 Core Concepts**: Each with the core insight and misconception to address, covering:
   - Debit/Credit positioning
   - Normal balance by account type
   - Accounting equation impact
   - Revenue recognition timing
   - Expense matching
   - Compound journal entries
   - Adjusting entries
   - Trial balance purpose
   - Reversing entries
   - Error detection patterns

3. **Learning Architecture**: Concept sequence from basic to advanced, with 5 key "aha moments"

4. **5 Authentic Scenarios**: Real-world contexts including startup month-end close, retail operations, service business growth, quarterly tax prep, and year-end audit readiness

The comment block was added without modifying any existing game logic, as required for Phase 1. I was unable to run the check script due to command approval restrictions, but the edit only adds a comment block which should not cause any TypeScript errors.
