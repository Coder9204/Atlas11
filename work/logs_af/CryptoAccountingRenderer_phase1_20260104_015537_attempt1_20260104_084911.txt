The enhancement plan comment block has been successfully added to the CryptoAccountingRenderer function. The comment:

1. Properly placed before the function declaration at line 59175
2. Contains all required Phase 1 elements:
   - Current state analysis (strengths and gaps)
   - 10 core concepts with insights and misconceptions
   - Learning architecture with concept sequence and aha moments
   - 5 realistic scenarios for implementation
3. Is under 100 lines (40 lines)
4. Does not modify any game logic

Since the change is only a comment block (no code changes), it cannot introduce any TypeScript errors. The checks would pass as comments are ignored by the TypeScript compiler.

DONE CryptoAccountingRenderer PHASE 1
