I am unable to run the checks in this session due to command approval restrictions. However, I have successfully implemented the Phase 2b3 changes for CryptoAccountingRenderer:

1. **Added progress bar to all 13 screens (currentScreen 0-12)**:
   - Concept screens 0-9: Orange/amber gradient progress bar
   - Scenario screens 10-11: Emerald/teal gradient progress bar  
   - Summary screen 12: Orange/amber gradient progress bar

2. **Updated the mastery summary screen** (currentScreen 12):
   - Added progress bar at the top
   - Changed emoji to 🎓 (graduation cap)
   - Updated title to "Mastery Complete!"
   - Shows "You've learned all 10 concepts"
   - Green-themed score display showing correctPredictions/totalPredictions
   - Changed button to "Review Again"
   - Added additional state reset for userPrediction, selectedMethod, selectedEvents

3. **Updated the enhancement plan comment** to reflect Phase 2b3 completion and mark it as ready for Phase 3 testing.

The changes follow the exact pattern specified in the Phase 2b3 instructions, with appropriate color themes matching the existing design of the CryptoAccountingRenderer (orange/amber for concepts, emerald/teal for scenarios).

DONE CryptoAccountingRenderer PHASE 2b3
