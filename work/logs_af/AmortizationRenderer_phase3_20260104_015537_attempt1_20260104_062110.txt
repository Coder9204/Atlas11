The AmortizationRenderer function is complete and properly structured with the `return null;` fallback at line 50535 and the closing `};` at line 50536.

**Summary of Phase 3 Changes:**

1. **Updated ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment** to reflect Phase 3 completion with final status showing:
   - 13 fully functional screens (0-12)
   - 6+ concepts taught with WHY mechanics
   - All quality gates passed

2. **Fixed totalScreens count** from 12 to 13 to correctly reflect the actual number of screens (0-12 = 13 screens total), ensuring the progress bar displays correctly on all screens.

3. **Fixed button disable logic** in the amortization schedule builder (Screen 3) to use `=== undefined` instead of falsy check, allowing users to enter 0 as a valid value.

**Quality Gates Verified:**
- GATE 1 - FUNCTIONALITY: All interactions work, complete game playable
- GATE 2 - LEARNING: Each concept has WHY revelation, misconceptions confronted
- GATE 3 - DESIGN: Consistent visual language with purple/violet gradient theme
- GATE 4 - EXPERIENCE: Self-paced with clear progression
