I've successfully added the Phase 1 enhancement plan comment block to the ProfitMarginRenderer function. The change adds a comprehensive research and design plan as a comment block at the top of the function without modifying any of the existing game logic.

The enhancement plan includes:
- Current state analysis identifying the game's strengths (visual margin waterfall, industry insights, quiz questions) and gaps (no trend analysis, no margin compression diagnosis, no sensitivity analysis)
- 10 core concepts that professionals use weekly, including margin hierarchy, operating leverage, contribution margin, industry economics, pricing power, and scale economics
- Learning architecture with concept sequencing and 4 key "aha moments"
- 5 real-world scenarios including "Margin Compression Detective", "Pricing Decision Simulator", "Scale Journey", "Industry Comparison", and "Turnaround Analysis"

The comment is correctly placed just before the `const ProfitMarginRenderer = () => {` declaration, and all existing game code remains unchanged.

DONE ProfitMarginRenderer PHASE 1
