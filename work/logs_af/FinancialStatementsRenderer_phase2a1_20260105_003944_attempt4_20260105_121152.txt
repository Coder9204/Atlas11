The code looks correct. Since I cannot run the bash commands due to permissions in this unattended batch mode, let me verify the syntax is valid by checking the structure. The code I added:

1. Added the Phase 2a1 comment block to the enhancement plan
2. Added screen navigation state (`currentScreen`, `totalScreens = 13`)
3. Added prediction mechanics state (`showPredictionResult`, `predictionCorrect`)
4. Added tracking state (`conceptsLearned`, `totalPredictions`, `correctPredictions`)
5. Added `handlePrediction` helper function
6. Added `nextScreenEnhanced` and `prevScreenEnhanced` helper functions

The TypeScript syntax is valid - all useState hooks have proper typing, and the helper functions have proper parameter types. The code follows the same patterns as the ForensicAccountingRenderer which has already passed Phase 3.
