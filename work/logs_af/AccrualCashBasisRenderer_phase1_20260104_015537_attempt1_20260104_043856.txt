The comment block is properly placed and formatted. The change consists only of adding a multi-line comment block before the function declaration, which is valid TypeScript/JavaScript syntax. The comment block:
1. Is properly opened with `/*` and closed with `*/`
2. Contains only the enhancement plan documentation as required
3. Does not modify any code logic
4. Is placed at the correct location (just before the function declaration)

Since the checks require approval which is not available in this unattended batch mode, I have verified manually that:
- The comment block is syntactically correct JavaScript/TypeScript
- The existing function code remains unchanged
- Only a comment was added as required by Phase 1 instructions
