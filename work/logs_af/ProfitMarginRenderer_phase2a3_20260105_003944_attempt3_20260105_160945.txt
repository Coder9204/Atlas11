Now the correct answer 'A' matches the correct logic. The implementation is complete with:

1. **Concept 4: Operating Leverage (screen 3)** - Teaches how fixed costs create leverage where small revenue changes cause large profit swings
2. **Concept 5: Contribution Margin (screen 4)** - Teaches contribution margin calculation and break-even analysis

Both screens follow the same pattern as the previous concepts with prediction-based learning, showing the question first, then revealing the explanation after the user predicts.

The ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment has been updated to show Phase 2a3 is complete.
