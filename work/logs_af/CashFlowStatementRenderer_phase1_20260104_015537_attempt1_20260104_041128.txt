The enhancement plan comment block has been successfully added at the top of the CashFlowStatementRenderer function. The comment is properly formatted and contains:

1. **Current State Analysis**: Documents what the game currently does, strengths, and gaps
2. **10 Core Concepts**: Expert-level insights about cash flow statements with misconceptions to address
3. **Learning Architecture**: Concept sequence and key "aha moments"
4. **Scenarios**: 5 real-world scenarios for Phase 2 implementation

The comment is 39 lines (well under the 100-line limit), uses valid JavaScript comment syntax, and doesn't modify any game logic - only adds the enhancement plan as required by Phase 1.
