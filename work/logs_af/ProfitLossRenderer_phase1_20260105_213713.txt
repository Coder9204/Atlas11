The enhancement plan comment block has been correctly added at lines 30085-30124, right before the `const ProfitLossRenderer = () => {` declaration at line 30125. The comment block follows the exact format specified:
- Includes "ENHANCEMENT PLAN - ProfitLossRenderer" header
- Shows "Phase 1 Complete: Research & Design"
- Contains CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS section
- Contains 10 CORE CONCEPTS with insights and misconceptions
- Contains LEARNING ARCHITECTURE with concept sequence and aha moments
- Contains 5 SCENARIOS
- Ends with "READY FOR PHASE 2: Implementation"

The change is a comment-only addition that does not affect TypeScript compilation. The syntax is valid JavaScript/TypeScript block comment format.
