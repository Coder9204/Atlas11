The code structure is correct:
- Line 64141: `return null;` - the fallthrough return
- Line 64142: `};` - closes the ForensicAccountingRenderer function
- Line 64144: `const CvpAnalysisRenderer = () => {` - next function starts

All the changes have been completed successfully for Phase 2b3:

1. **Progress bar added to all 13 screens** (screens 0-12 in the enhanced concept flow)
2. **Mastery summary screen added** at `currentScreenEnhanced === 12` with:
   - Progress bar
   - Graduation emoji
   - "Mastery Complete!" title
   - Prediction score display

   - "Review Again" button
3. **Enhancement plan comment updated** to reflect Phase 2b3 completion
