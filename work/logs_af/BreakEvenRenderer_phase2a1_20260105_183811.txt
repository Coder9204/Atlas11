All changes have been successfully implemented. Let me summarize what was done:

1. **Updated the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment** (lines 30364-30368) to include Phase 2a1 Complete status with checkmarks for all infrastructure items.

2. **Added prediction state variables** (lines 30381-30392):
   - `currentScreen` and `totalScreens = 13` for screen navigation
   - `showPredictionResult` and `predictionCorrect` for prediction mechanics
   - `conceptsLearned`, `totalPredictions`, `correctPredictions` for tracking

3. **Added helper functions** (lines 30394-30418):
   - `handlePrediction()` - handles prediction flow, tracks correctness and concepts learned
   - `nextScreen()` - navigates forward with state reset
   - `prevScreen()` - navigates backward with state reset

The existing game logic remains completely intact - I only added infrastructure that will be used in later phases.
