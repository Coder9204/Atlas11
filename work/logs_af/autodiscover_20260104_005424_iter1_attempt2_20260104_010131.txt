The mapping is still correct. The code structure is verified. Since I cannot run the checks script directly in this environment without approval, I have verified:

1. The file structure is intact (head and tail show proper React component boundaries)
2. The AccountingEquationRenderer is properly closed with `};`
3. The next renderer (DoubleEntryBookkeepingRenderer) starts correctly
4. The switch case mapping still points to the correct renderer
5. The total line count of the file is reasonable (77260 lines)

The updated AccountingEquationRenderer now includes:
- 10 core concepts with insights, misconceptions, and WHY explanations
- 10 screens with different screen types (intro, concept, prediction, simulation, misconception, transfer, mastery)
- Prediction-Action-Revelation learning loop
- Before/After state visualization for transactions
- Misconception confrontation mechanics
- Transfer challenges for real-world application
- Interactive simulation with 6 transaction types
- Mastery summary with key principles
