Good, the file is intact. Let me also verify the screen count is correct by checking the number of enhanced screens from the ENHANCEMENT PLAN. We have:
- Concepts 1-8: currentScreen 0-7 (8 screens)
- Concept 9: currentScreen 8 (1 screen)
- Concept 10: currentScreen 9 (1 screen)
- Scenario 1: currentScreen 10 (1 screen)
- Scenario 2: currentScreen 11 (1 screen)
- Total: 12 enhanced screens

The totalScreensEnhanced is set to 13 (for 10 concepts + 2 scenarios + 1 summary), but since the summary screen (screen 12) will be added in Phase 2b3, this is correct for now.

The implementation is complete for Phase 2b2:

1. **Concept 9: Transfer Pricing** (currentScreen === 8) - Teaches why transfer pricing should be between minimum (variable cost) and maximum (external price) to benefit both divisions
2. **Concept 10: Activity-Based Costing** (currentScreen === 9) - Teaches why traditional costing distorts costs for low-volume complex products vs high-volume simple products
3. **Scenario 1: New Product Launch Decision** (currentScreen === 10) - Combines sunk costs, contribution margin, and relevant cost analysis
4. **Scenario 2: Division Performance Crisis** (currentScreen === 11) - Combines allocated costs, sunk costs (depreciation), and contribution margin analysis
