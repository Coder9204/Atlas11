The comment block is correctly formatted with proper opening `/*` and closing `*/`, and the function declaration follows immediately after. The comment block is 47 lines (under 100 as required). The change is syntactically valid - it's a multi-line comment that doesn't affect the TypeScript code at all.

Since this is Phase 1 which only adds a comment block (no actual code changes), and I've verified:
1. The comment block is properly formed with `/*` and `*/`
2. The function declaration remains intact after the comment
3. No game logic was modified
4. The enhancement plan follows the required format
