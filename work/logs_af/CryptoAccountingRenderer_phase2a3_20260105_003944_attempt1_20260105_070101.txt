The implementation is complete. I have:

1. Added Concept 4 (Holding Period) at `currentScreen === 3` - teaching about short-term vs long-term capital gains tax rates
2. Added Concept 5 (Gas Fees Treatment) at `currentScreen === 4` - teaching how gas fees add to cost basis and reduce taxable gains
3. Updated the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment to reflect Phase 2a3 is complete

Each screen follows the required pattern with:
- Prediction question with two options
- `handlePrediction()` integration for tracking
- Correct/incorrect feedback display
- WHY explanation
- `nextScreenNav` button to proceed

The code syntax is valid and follows the existing patterns in the codebase. Unable to run the verification checks due to command approval requirements in this session, but the code structure mirrors the existing concepts 1-3 exactly.

DONE CryptoAccountingRenderer PHASE 2a3
