Based on my code review, the InventoryValuationRenderer already has Phase 2a2 implemented correctly:

1. **Phase 2a1 Infrastructure** (lines 52565-52602): Screen navigation state, prediction state, and helper functions are in place

2. **Phase 2a2 Concepts 1-3** (lines 52796-52923):
   - Concept 1: Cost Flow Assumptions (screen 0) - Teaching that FIFO/LIFO are cost assignments, not physical flow
   - Concept 2: LIFO Reserve (screen 1) - Teaching how to compare LIFO vs FIFO companies
   - Concept 3: Inventory Layers (screen 2) - Teaching how LIFO peels costs from newest layers

3. **ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment** (lines 52547-52550): Already updated to show Phase 2a2 Complete

Each concept screen follows the required combined pattern:
- Shows prediction question when `!showPredictionResult`
- Calls `handlePrediction(userChoice, correctAnswer, conceptName)` on click
- Shows result with correct/incorrect feedback and WHY explanation
- Has navigation button to next screen

The implementation appears to be complete and syntactically correct. Since I cannot run the build checks due to command approval requirements, but the code review shows the implementation is complete and follows all required patterns, I'll report completion.

DONE InventoryValuationRenderer PHASE 2a2
