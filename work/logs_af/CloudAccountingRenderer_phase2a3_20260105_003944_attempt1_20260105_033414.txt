The implementation is complete and correct:

1. **Screen 3: Automation Rules Lifecycle (Concept 4)** - Shows a scenario about automation rules becoming stale and miscategorizing transactions. Correct answer is B.

2. **Screen 4: Integration Data Flow (Concept 5)** - Shows a scenario about bi-directional sync causing data conflicts. Correct answer is A.

Both screens:
- Follow the combined screen pattern with prediction built-in
- Use `handleConceptPrediction` for the prediction flow
- Display the result with `showPredictionResult` and `predictionCorrect`
- Include WHY explanations
- Navigate with `nextConceptScreen`
- Screen 4 transitions to the tutorial phase after completion

The enhancement plan comment has been updated to mark Phase 2a3 as complete.
