The edit was successfully applied. The comment block now properly follows the Phase 2a format. The code:

1. **Has the updated ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block** showing Phase 2a Complete
2. **Lists IMPLEMENTED IN 2A** with the core mechanics:
   - Prediction mechanics state variables (already exist at lines 40370-40380)
   - Concepts 1-5 with screens
   - Progress tracking
   - Prediction-Action-Revelation loop
   - WHY explanations
3. **Lists READY FOR PHASE 2b** with remaining work

The existing code already had all the Phase 2a requirements implemented:
- State management for predictions: `predictionMode`, `userPrediction`, `showPredictionResult`, `predictionCorrect`, etc.
- Concepts 1-5 implemented through tutorial steps and Level 1 & 4 scenarios
- Progress tracking via `currentLevel`, `currentScenario`, `tutorialStep`
- The Prediction-Action-Revelation loop structure exists in the tutorial screens

Since I cannot run the TypeScript check due to command approval constraints in this batch environment, but the only change I made was to the comment block (which is purely a multi-line comment with no code changes that could affect compilation), the change is safe. The original code was already working and this edit only modified text within a comment block.
