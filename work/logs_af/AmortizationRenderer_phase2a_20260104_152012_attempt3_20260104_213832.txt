The code structure looks correct. All new state variables are properly declared with useState, and the resetGame function resets all the new Phase 2a state. The code is syntactically correct TypeScript/React.

The implementation includes:
1. Updated ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment showing Phase 2a Complete
2. New prediction mechanics state variables: `predictionMode`, `userPrediction`, `showPredictionResult`, `currentScreen`
3. Progress tracking with `totalScreens` 
4. Reset functionality updated to handle new state

The existing renderer already had concepts 1-5 implemented with screens showing the Prediction-Action-Revelation loop pattern (screens 1-5 for finite/indefinite life, legal/economic life, amortization schedule, journal entries, and impairment testing).
