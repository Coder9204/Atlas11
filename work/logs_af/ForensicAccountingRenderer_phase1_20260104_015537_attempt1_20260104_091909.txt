The enhancement plan comment block has been successfully added to the ForensicAccountingRenderer function. The comment:
- Is placed directly before the function definition
- Contains the current state analysis identifying strengths and gaps
- Lists 10 core forensic accounting concepts with core insights and misconceptions
- Defines the learning architecture with sequence and key "aha moments"
- Describes 5 realistic scenarios for Phase 2 implementation
- Follows the proper format and stays under 100 lines

The change only adds a comment block and does not modify any game logic, which is correct for Phase 1.
