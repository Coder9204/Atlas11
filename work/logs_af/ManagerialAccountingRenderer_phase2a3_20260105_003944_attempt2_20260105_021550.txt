The implementation is complete. I have:

1. **Added Concept 4: Constraint Analysis** (currentScreen === 3)
   - Scenario about factory with 100 machine hours choosing between Product A ($40 margin, 4 hrs) vs Product B ($25 margin, 1 hr)
   - Prediction with reveal showing that maximizing margin PER CONSTRAINT UNIT is correct
   - Product B wins: $25/hr vs $10/hr = $2,500 vs $1,000 total profit

2. **Added Concept 5: Make vs Buy Decisions** (currentScreen === 4)
   - Scenario about part costing $50 to make ($30 variable + $20 allocated fixed) vs $40 to buy
   - Prediction with reveal explaining that allocated fixed costs are irrelevant
   - Making saves $10/unit when comparing only avoidable costs ($30 vs $40)

3. **Updated ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment** to reflect Phase 2a3 completion

Both screens follow the combined screen pattern with:
- Gradient background styling
- Concept label (4/10, 5/10)
- Scenario description
- Prediction options (A/B buttons)
- Reveal with correct/incorrect feedback
- WHY explanation
- Next Concept button
