All the enhanced state variables and helper functions from Phase 2a1 are in place:
- `currentScreenEnhanced` - for navigation
- `showPredictionResultEnhanced` - for prediction reveal state
- `predictionCorrectEnhanced` - for tracking if prediction was correct
- `conceptsLearned` - for tracking learned concepts
- `handlePredictionEnhanced` - helper for prediction flow
- `nextScreenEnhanced` - helper for navigation

The implementation of Phase 2a2 is complete with:
1. **Concept 1: Fraud Triangle** - screen at `currentScreenEnhanced === 0` with prediction about what enables fraud
2. **Concept 2: Benford's Law** - screen at `currentScreenEnhanced === 1` with prediction about first-digit distribution
3. **Concept 3: Behavioral Red Flags** - screen at `currentScreenEnhanced === 2` with prediction about lifestyle red flags

Each screen follows the combined screen pattern with:
- Concept indicator ("CONCEPT X OF 10")
- Title
- Scenario description
- Prediction buttons (before reveal)
- Correct/incorrect feedback (after reveal)
- WHY explanation (after reveal)
- Next Concept button (after reveal)
