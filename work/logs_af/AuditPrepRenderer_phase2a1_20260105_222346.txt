The changes have been successfully made. The infrastructure for Phase 2a1 has been added:

1. **ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment updated** with Phase 2a1 Complete status
2. **Screen navigation state**:
   - `currentScreen` (useState)
   - `totalScreens = 13`
3. **Prediction mechanics**:
   - `showPredictionResult` (useState)
   - `predictionCorrect` (useState)
4. **Tracking state**:
   - `conceptsLearned` (useState<string[]>)
   - `totalPredictions` (useState)
   - `correctPredictions` (useState)
5. **Helper functions**:
   - `handlePrediction()` - handles prediction flow with tracking
   - `nextScreen()` - navigates forward with state reset
   - `prevScreen()` - navigates backward with state reset

The code follows proper TypeScript syntax and matches the existing indentation patterns in the file. All infrastructure is in place for the subsequent phases to implement screens and concepts.
