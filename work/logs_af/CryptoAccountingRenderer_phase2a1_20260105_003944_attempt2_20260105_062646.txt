The code looks correctly added. The Phase 2a1 infrastructure has been successfully added to the CryptoAccountingRenderer:

1. **Screen navigation state** (line 65254-65256):
   - `currentScreen` state variable
   - `totalScreens = 13` (10 concepts + 2 scenarios + 1 summary)

2. **Prediction mechanics** (lines 65258-65260):
   - `showPredictionResult` state
   - `predictionCorrect` state

3. **Tracking state** (lines 65262-65265):
   - `conceptsLearned` array
   - `totalPredictions` counter
   - `correctPredictions` counter

4. **Helper functions** (lines 65280-65304):
   - `handlePrediction()` - handles prediction flow with tracking
   - `nextScreenNav()` - navigates to next screen with state reset
   - `prevScreen()` - navigates to previous screen with state reset

5. **Updated ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment** (lines 65228-65243) marking Phase 2a1 as complete and ready for Phase 2a2.

The existing game logic and screen implementations remain intact, while the new infrastructure is in place for the enhanced predict-and-learn system.

DONE CryptoAccountingRenderer PHASE 2a1
