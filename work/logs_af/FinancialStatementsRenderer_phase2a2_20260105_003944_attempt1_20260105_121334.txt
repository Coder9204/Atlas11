The code correctly uses all the state variables and helper functions from Phase 2a1:
- `currentScreen` - for screen navigation
- `showPredictionResult` - to show/hide prediction result
- `predictionCorrect` - to track if prediction was correct
- `handlePrediction` - called on button clicks
- `nextScreenEnhanced` - called to move to next screen

The implementation is complete. The code follows the pattern specified with:
1. Concept 1: Cash vs Profit (screen 0) - teaches that profitable companies can go bankrupt from cash timing
2. Concept 2: Margin Waterfall (screen 1) - teaches that the gap between gross/net margins reveals efficiency
3. Concept 3: Working Capital Cycle (screen 2) - teaches that growth consumes cash

Each concept has:
- A scenario description
- Prediction question with A/B options
- Click-to-reveal with correct/incorrect feedback
- WHY explanation with real-world example
- Next button to proceed

The ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment has been updated to reflect Phase 2a2 completion.
