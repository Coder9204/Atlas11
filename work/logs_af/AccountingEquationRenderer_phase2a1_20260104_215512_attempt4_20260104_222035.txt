The code looks syntactically correct. The infrastructure has been added:

1. **Screen navigation state** (lines 39647-39649):
   - `currentScreen` - tracks which screen user is on
   - `totalScreens` - set to 14 (10 concepts + 2 scenarios + intro + summary)

2. **Prediction mechanics state** (lines 39651-39655):
   - `predictionMode` - whether user is in prediction mode
   - `userPrediction` - user's selected prediction
   - `showPredictionResult` - whether to show result feedback
   - `predictionCorrect` - whether prediction was correct

3. **Learning tracking state** (lines 39657-39660):
   - `conceptsLearned` - array of learned concept names
   - `totalPredictions` - count of all predictions made
   - `correctPredictions` - count of correct predictions

4. **Helper functions** (lines 39662-39689):
   - `handlePrediction()` - processes user predictions, updates score tracking
   - `nextScreen()` - moves forward, resets prediction state
   - `prevScreen()` - moves backward, resets prediction state

5. **Enhancement plan comment** updated to show Phase 2a1 complete with checklist of added items.

The code follows the existing patterns in the file (useState hooks, arrow functions, proper TypeScript types) and all the infrastructure required for Phase 2a1 has been added.
