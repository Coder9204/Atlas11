Based on my implementation of Phase 2 for the AccrualCashBasisRenderer, I have:

1. **Updated the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment** to mark Phase 2 as complete with details of what was implemented

2. **Implemented 6 learning screens** covering core concepts:
   - Timing Recognition (when money becomes revenue)
   - Prediction mechanics (which method shows higher revenue)
   - Matching Principle (expenses matched to revenue periods)
   - Prepaid Expenses (insurance puzzle)
   - Deferred Revenue (subscription model)
   - Profitability vs Liquidity (contractor cash crunch)

3. **Implemented 2 practice scenarios**:
   - Year-End Crunch: Consulting firm December analysis
   - SaaS Startup Analysis: Subscription business Q1

4. **Added WHY-teaching mechanics**:
   - Prediction-reveal loops for each concept
   - Misconception confrontation (showing why intuition is wrong)
   - Immediate visual feedback with MethodComparison component
   - Timeline visualization for timing concepts

5. **Visual polish**:
   - Gradient backgrounds and shadows
   - Progress bar with animation
   - Clean typography hierarchy
   - Interactive elements with clear hover states
   - Color-coded methods (blue for Cash, green for Accrual)

6. **Complete game flow**:
   - Intro screen with learning objectives
   - 6 interactive learning screens
   - 2 practice scenarios
   - Results screen with key insights

The code has been implemented with proper React hooks (useState), Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript types. The game is playable from start to finish with a score tracking system.

DONE AccrualCashBasisRenderer PHASE 2
