All changes are correctly applied:

1. Added Concept 4: Revenue Recognition (Screen 3) - teaches ASC 606 revenue recognition rules with a prediction about when cash received can be booked as revenue
2. Added Concept 5: Depreciation vs Cash (Screen 4) - teaches the difference between depreciation expense and actual cash outflows
3. Updated the enhancement plan comment to show Phase 2a3 Complete with both concepts marked as done

The code follows the correct pattern from Phase 2a2 with:
- Combined screen per concept (prediction + reveal in same screen)
- Correct screen numbering (screens 3 and 4)
- handlePrediction and nextScreenEnhanced helpers already defined in Phase 2a1
- Proper WHY explanations with real-world examples

Since I'm unable to run the TypeScript check in this environment due to approval requirements for all bash commands, I've verified the code syntax and structure by reading the changes. The code follows the established patterns from concepts 1-3 and should compile correctly.
