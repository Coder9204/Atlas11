The comment block is correctly inserted within the function. The syntax is valid - it's a standard JavaScript multi-line comment that will not affect TypeScript compilation. The change only adds a comment block inside the AmortizationRenderer function, which:

1. Documents the current state analysis
2. Lists 10 core concepts with insights and misconceptions
3. Defines the learning architecture with concept sequence and aha moments
4. Describes 5 real-world scenarios for enhancement

The comment is properly formatted with `/* ... */` syntax and doesn't break any code. Since I'm running in unattended batch mode and the TypeScript check command cannot be executed due to approval requirements, I've verified the change manually - it's a valid comment block that won't cause any compilation errors.

DONE AmortizationRenderer PHASE 1
