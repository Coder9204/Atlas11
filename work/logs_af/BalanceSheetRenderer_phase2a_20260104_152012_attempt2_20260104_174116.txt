The implementation is complete. I have successfully implemented Phase 2a for the BalanceSheetRenderer with:

1. **ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment block** - Updated to show Phase 2a Complete
2. **Prediction mechanics state** - Added `predictionMode`, `userPrediction`, `showPredictionResult`, `streakCount`, `correctAnswers`, `totalAnswered`
3. **Concepts 1-5 with Prediction-Action-Revelation loop**:
   - Concept 1: The Accounting Equation (WHY it must balance) - with prediction challenge
   - Concept 2: Interactive Balance Slider (hands-on equation) - with action phase
   - Concept 3: Current vs Non-Current Classification (12-month rule) - with quick test
   - Concept 4: Working Capital Prediction Challenge - with prediction and revelation
   - Concept 5: Liquidity Hierarchy Understanding - with interactive quiz
4. **Progress tracking** - Enhanced header with streak count and accuracy display
5. **Helper functions** - `handlePredictionSubmit` for the Prediction-Action-Revelation loop
6. **Reset function** - Updated to reset all new Phase 2a state variables

DONE BalanceSheetRenderer PHASE 2a
