The enhancement plan comment block has been successfully added to the BreakEvenAnalysisRenderer function. The change is a comment-only modification that:

1. Documents the current state analysis of the game
2. Lists 10 core concepts with their key insights and misconceptions to address
3. Defines the learning architecture with concept sequencing and "aha moments"
4. Outlines 5 authentic real-world scenarios for Phase 2 implementation

The change is syntactically valid (it's purely a comment block) and does not modify any game logic, which aligns with Phase 1 requirements.
