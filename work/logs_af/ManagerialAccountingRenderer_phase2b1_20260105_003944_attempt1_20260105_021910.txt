All the state variables are correctly defined. The implementation is complete and follows the established patterns from phases 2a2 and 2a3.

Summary of Phase 2b1 implementation:
- Added Concept 6: Special Order Decisions (currentScreen === 5)
- Added Concept 7: Variance Analysis (currentScreen === 6)  
- Added Concept 8: Operating Leverage (currentScreen === 7)
- Each screen follows the combined pattern with prediction built-in (click to reveal)
- Updated the ENHANCEMENT PLAN comment to show Phase 2b1 is complete

The code follows the exact same pattern as concepts 1-5 and uses the existing helper functions (`handlePredictionFlow`, `nextScreenEnhanced`, `showPredictionResult`, `predictionCorrect`).
