The code changes have been successfully implemented:

1. **Enhancement Plan Updated**: Added Phase 2a2 documentation showing:
   - Concept 1: Industry Context Trap - 1 combined screen with prediction
   - Concept 2: Industry Benchmarks Comparison - 1 combined screen with prediction  
   - Concept 3: Context Application - 1 combined screen with prediction

2. **Concepts 1-3 Implemented**: The 'learn' phase now has 3 combined screens following the specified pattern:
   - Each screen has a dark gradient background (slate-900 via-indigo-900)
   - Each shows "CONCEPT X OF 10" header
   - Each has prediction built-in (A/B options with click handlers)
   - Each uses the `!revealed` state to show prediction UI, then reveal with WHY explanation
   - Each has proper Next button progression

3. **Pattern Followed**: All 3 screens use the COMBINED SCREEN PATTERN:
   - Scenario description in white/10 card
   - Two option buttons with handlePrediction
   - "Check Answer" button when prediction made
   - Correct/incorrect feedback with color coding
   - WHY explanation section
   - Next Concept button

The code structure is syntactically correct - proper JSX, state management, and transitions between screens are maintained.
