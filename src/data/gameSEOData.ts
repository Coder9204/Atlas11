    faqItems: [
      { question: 'What is Newton\'s Third Law?', answer: 'For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. When you push a wall, the wall pushes back on you with the same magnitude.' },
      { question: 'Why don\'t action-reaction forces cancel out?', answer: 'They act on different objects. You push the wall (force on wall) and the wall pushes you (force on you). Since they act on different bodies, they do not cancel.' },

      { question: 'Does momentum conservation apply to explosions?', answer: 'Yes. An explosion is a collision in reverse. Total momentum of all fragments after the explosion equals total momentum before (usually zero for a stationary object).' },

    estimatedMinutes: 8,
    faqItems: [
      { question: 'Why is static friction greater than kinetic friction?', answer: 'At rest, surface asperities interlock and form micro-bonds. Once sliding begins, contacts are more transient, reducing the average friction force by 10-30%.' },

    estimatedMinutes: 8,
    faqItems: [
      { question: 'Why does a skater spin faster when pulling in their arms?', answer: 'Angular momentum L = I*omega is conserved. Reducing I (pulling arms in) forces omega to increase proportionally.' },
      { question: 'What is the angular momentum of the Earth?', answer: 'About 7.1 x 10^33 kg*m^2/s from rotation alone. This is why Earth\'s rotation changes extremely slowly over millions of years (tidal deceleration).' },

    difficulty: 'beginner',
    estimatedMinutes: 5,
    faqItems: [

      { question: 'What is the Q factor?', answer: 'Q = f_resonance / bandwidth. It measures how sharply peaked the resonance is. A tuning fork (Q ~ 1000) rings for seconds; a drum (Q ~ 10) dies quickly.' },

    estimatedMinutes: 5,
    faqItems: [
      { question: 'What determines if an object floats or sinks?', answer: 'An object floats if its average density is less than the fluid density. A steel ship floats because its average density (including air inside) is less than water.' },
      { question: 'Does shape affect buoyancy?', answer: 'Shape does not change the buoyant force on a fully submerged object (only displaced volume matters). But shape determines stability and whether the object capsizes.' },
