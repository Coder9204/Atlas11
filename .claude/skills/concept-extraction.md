# SKILL 1: CONCEPT EXTRACTION

## Purpose

Before you can teach something, you must deeply understand:
- What the REAL insight is (not the surface-level definition)
- What people get WRONG (the misconception you're fighting)
- What VARIABLES interact (the system you're simulating)
- What EXPERTS know that BEGINNERS don't

**Without this foundation, you'll build a quiz, not a learning experience.**

## THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

### The Mechanics ARE the Curriculum

The best educational games don't teach then test—**the gameplay IS the learning**:

- **DragonBox** doesn't explain algebra then quiz you; the moves you make to progress ARE algebraic operations
- **Kerbal Space Program** doesn't describe orbits then ask questions; the rocket either achieves orbit or crashes
- **Human Resource Machine** doesn't lecture about programming; your code IS the controller

**The Ultimate Test:** Can someone who completes your game explain the concepts to another person—without ever being "taught" explicitly? If yes, you succeeded.

## THE 7 EXTRACTION QUESTIONS

### Q1: What is the ONE sentence an expert knows that a beginner doesn't?

This is not a definition. It's an insight that changes how you think.

**Bad (definitions):**
- "Compound interest is interest calculated on principal and accumulated interest"

**Good (insights):**
- "Small differences in rate create enormous differences over time because growth is exponential, not linear"

**How to find it:**
1. "What surprised me when I truly understood this?"
2. "What would I tell my past self to save years of confusion?"

```
YOUR ANSWER:
After understanding this, the learner will know that _____________
because _____________.
```

---

### Q2: What do beginners get WRONG? (The misconception)

Every concept has a "natural" wrong belief. This is what you're fighting.

**Pattern:** "Most people think [X], but actually [Y], because [Z]."

| Topic | Wrong Belief | Reality | Why It Feels True |
|-------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Compound interest | 10% more rate = 10% more money | It's exponentially more | We think linearly |
| Probability | Past affects future | Each event is independent | We see patterns |
| Orbits | Objects in orbit are weightless | They're in constant freefall | "Floating" = no gravity |
| Newton's Laws | Objects naturally slow down | Objects maintain velocity without force | Friction is everywhere |

```
YOUR ANSWER:
Most beginners think _____________, but actually _____________.
This feels true because _____________.
```

---

### Q3: What are the VARIABLES in this system?

```
INPUT VARIABLES (what can be changed):
- [Variable 1]: [What it is] | Range: [realistic values]
- [Variable 2]: [What it is] | Range: [realistic values]

OUTPUT VARIABLES (what responds):
- [Output 1]: [What it measures] | Affected by: [which inputs]
- [Output 2]: [What it measures] | Affected by: [which inputs]

KEY RELATIONSHIP:
When [input] increases, [output] [increases/decreases] because [mechanism].
```

---

### Q4: What's the CAUSAL CHAIN?

Don't just state what happens—explain WHY, step by step.

**Format:** A happens → which causes B → which causes C → which results in D

**Example (Compound Interest):**
```
Rate is set higher →
  Each year's interest is larger →
    That larger interest becomes part of principal →
      Next year's interest is calculated on bigger base →
        The gap between low and high rate WIDENS each year →
          Over decades, small rate differences become huge dollar differences
```

### Q5: What creates the "AHA!" moment?

The aha moment is when the misconception breaks.

| Pattern | How It Works | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Prediction failure | They predict wrong, see reality | "I thought 10% vs 5% would be 2x, but it's 4x!" |
| Extreme case | Push variables to extremes | "At 100 years, the difference is astronomical" |
| Side-by-side | Compare two scenarios | "Starting 10 years earlier beats higher rate" |
| Counter-intuitive | Show something "impossible" | "The feather and ball fall at same speed in vacuum" |
| Visible mechanism | Show the WHY, not just WHAT | "Watch the interest ITSELF earn interest" |

```
YOUR ANSWER:
The aha moment happens when they see _____________ and realize _____________.
```

### Q6: What REAL-WORLD SCENARIO makes this concrete for a child?

**Requirements:**
- Relatable person (name, age, situation child understands)
- Stakes they care about (saving for something, helping someone)
- Authentic decision (one real people face)
- Realistic numbers (researched, not made up)
- Expert would approve the simplification

**Age-appropriate adaptations:**
| Adult Scenario | Child Version | Same Concept |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Retirement savings | Saving for a bike/game | Compound growth |
| Mortgage rates | Borrowing allowance with "interest" | Debt cost |
| Stock portfolio | Not all eggs in one basket | Risk distribution |
| Supply/demand | Lemonade stand pricing | Market equilibrium |
| Newton's Laws | Pushing a shopping cart | Force and mass |

### Q7: What are the 3-5 KNOWLEDGE COMPONENTS?

Break the concept into teachable pieces that build on each other.

```
KC-1: [Name]
- What it is: [One sentence]
- Prerequisite: None / KC-X
- Misconception: [What they get wrong]
- Mastery sign: [What they can do when they understand]

KC-2: [Name]
- What it is: [One sentence]
- Prerequisite: KC-1
- Misconception: [What they get wrong]
- Mastery sign: [What they can do when they understand]
```
