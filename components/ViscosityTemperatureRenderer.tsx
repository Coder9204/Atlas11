      { id: 'viscosity', label: "Cold temperatures increase viscosity (internal friction)", correct: true },
      { id: 'density', label: "Cold syrup is denser and heavier" },
      { id: 'sticky', label: "Cold makes sugar crystals stickier" }
    ],
    explanation: "At lower temperatures, molecules move more slowly and have stronger intermolecular attractions, increasing viscosity (resistance to flow). The syrup isn't frozen, just more viscous."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You warm the syrup bottle in hot water before pouring.",
    question: "What happens to the syrup's viscosity when heated?",
    options: [
      { id: 'increase', label: "Viscosity increases — it gets thicker" },
      { id: 'decrease', label: "Viscosity decreases — it flows more easily", correct: true },
      { id: 'same', label: "Viscosity stays the same — only color changes" },
      { id: 'solidify', label: "The syrup eventually solidifies" }
    ],
    explanation: "Heating gives molecules more kinetic energy, allowing them to overcome intermolecular attractions more easily. This reduces viscosity dramatically — warm syrup pours much faster."
  },
  {
    scenario: "A mechanic is explaining why engines need different oils for different climates.",
    question: "Why do cars in cold climates need 'winter-weight' oil?",
    options: [
      { id: 'freeze', label: "Regular oil freezes in winter" },
      { id: 'thick', label: "Cold makes oil too viscous to flow and lubricate properly", correct: true },
      { id: 'thin', label: "Cold makes oil too thin to protect the engine" },
      { id: 'evaporate', label: "Regular oil evaporates in cold weather" }
    ],
    explanation: "In cold weather, regular oil becomes very viscous (thick) and can't flow quickly enough to lubricate engine parts during startup. Winter oils have additives that keep them flowing at low temperatures."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You notice honey flows easily on a warm day but barely moves when refrigerated.",
    question: "What molecular process explains this temperature-viscosity relationship?",
    options: [
      { id: 'bonds', label: "Chemical bonds break at higher temperatures" },
      { id: 'kinetic', label: "Higher temperature = more molecular motion, easier to overcome attractions", correct: true },
      { id: 'expansion', label: "Heat expands the container, giving more room to flow" },
      { id: 'evaporation', label: "Water evaporates, leaving thinner honey" }
    ],
    explanation: "Temperature increases molecular kinetic energy. Faster-moving molecules can more easily break free from intermolecular forces (like hydrogen bonds), reducing resistance to flow."
  },
  {
    scenario: "A glass factory heats sand to make glass.",
    question: "Why must glass be extremely hot to be shaped?",

      { id: 'soft', label: "Heat makes the silicon atoms soft" },
      { id: 'chemical', label: "Heat causes a chemical reaction that makes glass moldable" }
    ],
    explanation: "Glass is an amorphous solid with extremely high viscosity at room temperature. Heating to ~1000°C+ dramatically reduces viscosity, allowing it to flow and be shaped before cooling and hardening."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're comparing water and honey at the same temperature.",
    question: "Why does honey have higher viscosity than water at room temperature?",
    options: [
      { id: 'sugar', label: "Sugar molecules create more internal friction and hydrogen bonds", correct: true },
      { id: 'density', label: "Honey is denser, so gravity pulls harder" },
      { id: 'temperature', label: "Honey is naturally colder than water" },
      { id: 'color', label: "Darker liquids are always more viscous" }
    ],
    explanation: "Honey contains large sugar molecules that interact strongly via hydrogen bonds. These molecular interactions create much more internal friction than water's small, simple molecules."
  },
  {
    scenario: "An engineer is designing a chocolate fountain.",
    question: "Why must the chocolate be kept warm in the fountain?",
    options: [

      { id: 'melt', label: "Chocolate must stay completely liquid" },
      { id: 'bacteria', label: "Heat prevents bacterial growth" }
    ],
    explanation: "Chocolate fountains maintain temperature around 40-50°C to keep viscosity low enough for smooth, continuous flow. If it cools, viscosity increases and the flow becomes sluggish or stops."

      { id: 'inverse', label: "Viscosity is inversely proportional to temperature" },
      { id: 'quadratic', label: "Viscosity decreases with the square of temperature" }
    ],
    explanation: "The Arrhenius equation shows η = A·e^(Ea/RT), meaning viscosity decreases exponentially as temperature increases. A small temperature change can cause a large viscosity change."
  },
  {
    scenario: "A volcano erupts, releasing lava that flows down the mountainside.",
    question: "Why does lava flow faster near the eruption vent than further down the slope?",
    options: [
      { id: 'slope', label: "The slope is steeper near the vent" },
      { id: 'temperature', label: "Lava is hottest (lowest viscosity) at the vent, cools as it flows", correct: true },
      { id: 'pressure', label: "Pressure from the volcano pushes it faster" },
      { id: 'composition', label: "The lava's composition changes as it flows" }
    ],
    explanation: "Fresh lava at the vent is extremely hot (~1200°C) with low viscosity. As it flows and cools, viscosity increases dramatically, slowing its movement until it eventually solidifies."

      { id: 'irrelevant', label: "Viscosity doesn't matter for medicines" }
